#Requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
  Install or update the Claude Code stack (skills, plugins, MCPs, hooks, agents, rules) into a project.

.DESCRIPTION
  PowerShell port of claude-stack.sh: every skill / plugin / MCP from claude-stack.html (the complete
  toolset, not a curated subset), installed INTO a project. Built-in/system CLI skills are excluded
  (they ship with the CLI). Requires the `claude` CLI; claude-only steps fail soft if it is absent.
  The Cursor stack lives in the cursor-stack repo.

  Windows differences vs claude-stack.sh: hook .js files are invoked via `node` (no shebang/exec bit);
  settings.json is merged natively (ConvertFrom/To-Json), no python dependency; MCP arg strings stay
  LITERAL (${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}) so Claude Code interpolates them at launch.

.PARAMETER Action
  REQUIRED. 'install' = first-time provision; MCP/plugin versions freeze until the next update; wires
  .claude/settings.json. 'update' = re-resolve every runtime to latest + refresh hooks/agents/rules;
  re-ensures the settings.json hook wiring (idempotent).

.PARAMETER Space
  Any word -> install into the ~/.claude-<Space> account (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is exported for the claude
  CLI) and use a separate memory_<Space>.db. Omit for the default ~/.claude account + shared memory.db.

.PARAMETER Scope
  'project' (default) installs INTO this repo; 'global' installs into the active account. Overrides the
  SCOPE env var; when neither is set, defaults to 'project'.

.PARAMETER Context7
  context7 transport: 'remote' (default) = the hosted HTTP server, no local process; 'local' = the
  local npx stdio server.

.PARAMETER SentrySlug
  Seed SENTRY_SLUG - the Sentry org ('<org>') or project ('<org>/<project>', Sentry's recommended form) -
  into the ACCOUNT settings.json 'env' (<account>\settings.json); the registration reads it at launch as
  https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp/${SENTRY_SLUG}. Absent = the env is left as it is.

.PARAMETER SentryAuth
  sentry MCP auth. 'token' (default) sends `Authorization: Sentry-Bearer ${SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN}` (a
  personal/org API token you add to the same account 'env' yourself); 'oauth' registers NO header, so
  Claude Code runs Sentry's browser consent flow on first connect instead. Both values expand from the
  ACCOUNT settings.json 'env' or the launch environment - never from a project-level .claude\settings.json
  (measured: that stays literal). update: absent = keep the mode the existing registration carries.

.PARAMETER PlaywrightBrowsers
  The browsers the playwright MCP can drive, comma-separated: any of 'chrome', 'msedge', 'firefox', 'webkit' -
  ONE server per engine (playwright-chrome, playwright-firefox, ...), each with its own profile in
  .playwright/<engine>. chrome and msedge use the browser installed on the machine; firefox and webkit are
  Playwright's own builds, downloaded by the run. Absent = keep the registered set (a legacy 'playwright'
  server counts as its engine), chrome when there is none. A dropped engine's server is removed.

.PARAMETER PlaywrightEnabled
  The one engine to keep switched on (one of the kept engines; given alone, it is added to the set). The run
  prints '/mcp disable playwright-<x>' for every other kept engine - switch any time with /mcp enable / disable.

.PARAMETER GitHubCli
  Install the GitHub CLI (gh) via winget if missing. Reminds you to run `gh auth login` when unauthenticated.

.PARAMETER KeepPins
  Keep this project's LOCAL model/effort frontmatter edits on installed agents (.claude/agents) and
  skills (SKILL.md) across the refresh - the local value is re-applied after the fetch/reinstall
  (which otherwise resets it to upstream). Only existing keys are re-applied; with the switch on, a
  local pin edit always wins over an upstream pin change.

.PARAMETER Selection
  Install ONLY the skills/plugins/mcps/agents/rules/hooks named in <file> (one 'category name' per
  line); a selection with no 'hook' lines installs all hooks.

.PARAMETER InstalledOnly
  Update only: derive the selection from what is already installed (skills/agents/rules/hooks on
  disk, mcps from .mcp.json; generated project-owned files excluded) and refresh exactly that -
  never adds, never removes. Closed through stack-select.js when it is reachable next to this
  script, so a dependency a new release introduced still installs. MCPs and PLUGINS are refreshed
  to the newest versions: the pinned MCP entries are re-resolved and re-registered, and every
  installed stack plugin gets 'claude plugin update'. Plugins come from 'claude plugin list'
  (machine-level - no project dir to read), intersected with the manifest, so a third-party plugin
  is never touched.

.PARAMETER PrintPlan
  With -Selection or -InstalledOnly, print the resolved per-category install set and exit (dry run).

.PARAMETER SkillsOnly
  Run only the skill install/update step, then exit (testability; skips prerequisites/plugins/mcps/
  hooks/agents/rules).

.PARAMETER Source
  Install FROM an existing claude-stack checkout instead of cloning one. The caller owns the
  directory - this script never deletes it. Used by the /claude-stack setup+configure skills, which
  clone once and pass it here so a guided run takes one clone, not two. Omit it and the script
  clones its own source (and removes it on exit) - the standalone path.

.NOTES
  Environment variables:
    SCOPE=project|global  fallback for -Scope when the flag is absent (default project).
    CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR     target a specific account when no -Space is given (default ~/.claude).
    STACK_SKILLS_REPO     stack source repo (release-archive download, git-clone fallback; default https://github.com/envoydev/claude-stack).
    CONTEXT7_API_KEY      context7 API key; add it to the ACCOUNT settings.json 'env' for higher rate limits (unset = the keyless free tier).
                          Set in the environment THIS script runs in, it is written into that file (every run, both scopes; logged by length).
    CONTEXT7_BAKE_KEY     with -Context7 local, bake CONTEXT7_API_KEY into the registration (keep .mcp.json uncommitted).
    SENTRY_SLUG           the Sentry org or org/project the sentry MCP URL is scoped to - lives in the ACCOUNT settings.json 'env'
                          (seeded by -SentrySlug, else from the launch environment); unset = a literal ${SENTRY_SLUG} URL that connects and then fails every call.
    SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN   -SentryAuth token (default): a sentry API token (Settings -> Account -> API -> Personal Tokens, or
                          an org token) - add it to the ACCOUNT settings.json 'env' yourself, or set it in the environment this
                          script runs in and the run writes it there (every run, both scopes; logged by length); never in .mcp.json, never in a
                          project-level settings.json (does not reach .mcp.json expansion). Not SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: that is
                          sentry-cli's release/symbol-upload credential (needs project:releases).

  On Windows PowerShell 5.1 use `powershell` instead of `pwsh`. If scripts are blocked, run once:
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.

.EXAMPLE
  .\claude-stack.ps1 install
  Install the full stack into the current project (default account, project scope).

.EXAMPLE
  .\claude-stack.ps1 install -Space work -GitHubCli
  Install into the ~/.claude-work account (+ memory_work.db) and install the GitHub CLI.

.EXAMPLE
  .\claude-stack.ps1 update -Scope global
  Update everything to latest in the global (~/.claude) account.

# (2) Plugins "<plugin>@<marketplace>" (non-default marketplaces added first).
#     What each one EXECUTES, read from the packages on 2026-09-12 - the trust decision belongs
#     beside the manifest, not in an audit nobody re-opens:
#       superpowers        1 SessionStart hook, no timeout (600s default), prints its own SKILL.md
#                          as additionalContext. No network, no credential, no bin/, no deps. The
#                          plugin.json version is what actually pins an update (a marketplace entry
#                          version is ignored when both exist) - and on one machine that single
#                          version had carried THREE different source commits, so the version
#                          identifies the release, never the code that ran. ACCEPTED COST, stated
#                          rather than fixed: that injected SKILL.md (3,108 chars every session)
#                          tells the model to invoke a skill before ANY response, which is the
#                          opposite of the house capabilities rule's 'load a skill for the work at
#                          hand, never to answer a question'. It arrives by hook, so not invoking
#                          the skill does not avoid it and no house-side edit can win; the four
#                          methods the house actually cites (plan, TDD, debug, verify-before-done)
#                          are worth the collision. Revisit by dropping the plugin and inlining
#                          those four, the way the seat disciplines are already inlined.
#       claude-md-management  no hooks, no MCP, no deps. Both components EDIT CLAUDE.md and neither
#                          carries `disable-model-invocation`, so a side-effect entry is
#                          model-invocable; guard-cross-project-write.js covers writes outside the
#                          root, not an in-root rewrite of the instruction file itself.
#       csharp-lsp /       the packages hold a LICENSE and a README and nothing else. The whole
#       typescript-lsp     definition lives on the MARKETPLACE ENTRY under `strict: false` (which
#                          makes the entry the entire definition and a package plugin.json a
#                          load-failing conflict), including the `lspServers` block. An EMPTY plugin
#                          cache directory is therefore the correct install, not a failed one.
#                          The only executable is the language server the user installs by hand.
#       security-guidance  12 hook entries. Its SessionStart (timeout 180) creates a venv and runs
#                          `pip install claude-agent-sdk` - network egress to PyPI on every session
#                          start, no lockfile, no --ignore-scripts. Its Stop, SubagentStop and seven
#                          PostToolUse Bash entries spawn an inner model call through the Agent SDK,
#                          which is BILLED; ten of them are asyncRewake so they wake the model in the
#                          background rather than blocking the turn. No settings write, no egress
#                          beyond PyPI and api.anthropic.com.
#       claude-hud         no hooks, no MCP, no bin/. Its own /claude-hud:setup writes a statusLine
#                          into the ACCOUNT settings.json - user-invoked, not a hook. Ships ~41MB of
#                          node_modules. Third-party marketplace, so auto-update is OFF and this
#                          installer's update pass is the only thing that moves it.
#     Costs nothing here counts: a plugin's SessionStart injection and its skill descriptions are
#     always-on context that lint check 33 cannot see (it reads this repo, not the plugin cache) -
#     `/claude-stack:status` reports the installed number.

# (3) MCP servers "name|args"; scope follows $Scope. SINGLE-QUOTED so ${...} stays LITERAL ->
#     Claude Code interpolates ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.} at server launch.
#     memory: uses ${HOME_MEMORY_DIR} - a script-local token resolved to $HOME\.memory-mcp at install
#     time (a fixed home path, so a Cursor install on the same machine shares the same DB). A space
#     (e.g. 'work') switches to a separate per-space DB (memory_<space>.db).
# PERFORMANCE (see claude-stack.sh for the full rationale): resolve each runtime's LATEST version
# HERE (install/update network step) and bake it into the registration. `install` skips already-
# registered MCPs, so the resolved version stays FROZEN until `update` re-resolves and bumps it -
# "latest at provision, frozen until next update", no hardcoded versions. Launch is fast because
# versions are PINNED (npx skips dist-tag resolution). Do NOT add --prefer-offline: against a
# freshly-resolved latest version a stale npm cache index reports "no matching version" and the
# server dies (-32000). serena runs from the pinned PyPI package (not git+https). memory injects
# --with numpy (its sqlite_vec backend needs numpy but the package doesn't declare it, so uvx's
# isolated env omits it -> "No module named 'numpy'"). Offline at provision -> empty -> unpinned.
# Bounded fetches (npm --fetch-timeout / Invoke-RestMethod -TimeoutSec) so a dead network fails fast to

# .claude\settings.json or settings.local.json "env" value does NOT reach .mcp.json expansion (measured:
# it stays literal; it reaches only the MCP child process environment). On Windows this is the reliable path (no setx/restart dance). Pass -Context7 local for

#                           (default) - Sentry's documented direct-token mode for a personal/org API token;
#                           plain `Bearer` is the server's OAuth-issued token scheme and rejects an API
#                           token as invalid_token (measured: AUTH_HEADER_REJECTED / 401 under it)
# -SentryAuth oauth registers NO header instead, so Claude Code runs Sentry's browser consent flow on
# first connect - a set-but-wrong header disables that fallback, which is why the modes never mix.

# SOURCE SNAPSHOT - the ONE revision every artifact in a run comes from
# ===========================================================================
# Every file the stack installs (skills, hooks, agents, rules, the CLAUDE.md template) lives in
# this one repo, so a run takes ONE source snapshot and copies out of it: the rolling 'latest'
# release archive (.github/workflows/release.yml republishes it on every push to main, with a
# RELEASE-SOURCE file inside naming the exact commit), falling back to a shallow git clone when
# no release is reachable (a fork without releases, a blocked CDN, the brief window while the
# workflow recreates the release). Why one snapshot and not the per-file
# raw.githubusercontent.com fetches this replaced:
#   - ATOMIC. An archive or clone is a single revision. The raw URLs are per-file and CDN-cached
#     (a push takes ~5 min to propagate), so a raw run could mix revisions - and then
#     claude-stack.stamp, which records the revision this install came from, would be a lie. The
#     snapshot makes the stamp true by construction.
#   - CHEAP. One download replaces ~50 round trips (the Hooks + Agents + ClaudeRules arrays).
# Fail-soft, like the fetches were: no source (archive AND clone failed) means callers keep the
# copies already on disk and the run carries on. $StackSha stays empty, which is what suppresses
# the stamp write.
#
# -Source <dir> hands in a source the CALLER already fetched (an extracted release archive or a
# git checkout). That is the plugin path: the setup / configure skills must download anyway (they
# need stack-select.js, stack-graph.json, the CLAUDE.md template and the stamp diff before the
# install runs), so they pass that same source here and the guided run costs ONE download instead
# of two. A caller-provided dir is borrowed, never deleted. Standalone (no -Source) is
# unchanged: the script fetches its own source and cleans it up.
