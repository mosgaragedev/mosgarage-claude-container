# /claude-stack - the router

Route by install state, then hand the user the ONE command to run. The five actions are
manual-only commands - the user stays at the wheel, so you answer with the command, never run
the flow yourself:

- Nothing installed here (no populated `.claude/skills` / `.claude/agents`, and no global install
  to target) -> `/claude-stack:setup` (fresh install from scratch).
- The stack is installed and the ask is a plain refresh (no items named) -> `/claude-stack:update`
  (refresh everything installed + prune what upstream removed).
- The stack is installed and the user wants to adjust it (add or drop items, change the
  selection) -> `/claude-stack:configure`.
- The stack is installed and the user wants it reconciled TO THIS PROJECT - prune what the
  project's frameworks do not use (WPF artifacts in a web-only repo, the data vertical with no SQL)
  AND add the detected stacks' artifacts that are missing -> `/claude-stack:validate` (project mode
  only).
- The ask is to SEE what is installed - inventory, versions, capture dates, 'what do I have?' -
  with nothing to change -> `/claude-stack:status` (read-only tables, per area or all).
- The install just finished and the ask is 'what now?' (session reload, gitignore lines, serena
  setup, which captures in which order) -> not a command: walk them through
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/post-install.md`.

Answer with the command plus one line naming the state you found (for example: 'no `.claude/skills`
here - run `/claude-stack:setup`'). When more than one reading is plausible, put the candidates
through AskUserQuestion - one option per plausible command, the likeliest marked Recommended -
instead of guessing or asking in prose.
