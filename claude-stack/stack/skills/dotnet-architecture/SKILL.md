description: "Choose and hold a .NET application architecture: where code belongs, layering or slicing, service and module boundaries, drift review. Use when the user says clean architecture, vertical slice, DDD, modular monolith, microservices or bounded context. Not for architecture tests or SQL tuning."

# dotnet-architecture (decision hub)

Decide the shape, then load the one style you chose. **Per-style depth lives in references - load exactly the ones your decision selects:**

- Layered internal structure -> `references/clean-architecture.md`
- Feature-sliced internal structure -> `references/vertical-slice.md`
- Rich domain (aggregates, invariants) -> `references/ddd.md` (additive - layers onto clean or vsa, does not replace it)
- Distinct bounded contexts in one deployable -> `references/modular-monolith.md`
- Independently deployed/scaled boundaries -> `references/microservices.md`

## Pick one, then commit

- **One internal style per codebase (or per module).** Clean and vertical-slice side by side means neither - a reader can't predict where anything lives.
- **In an established codebase the existing architecture wins.** Match it exactly; never introduce a 'better' second pattern.
- **Greenfield is a deliberate choice.** Load one style reference and build to it.
- **Record the choice where the project keeps decisions** - the style picked, the two alternatives rejected, and why - so the next reader inherits the reason and not just the folder layout. An architecture decision nobody wrote down is re-litigated at the next module.

## Decide on two axes (plus one additive)

**Topology - how many deployables, where the boundaries are.** Default to the least distributed thing that works:

| Situation | Topology |
|---|---|
| One team, one domain, most apps | single deployable (a monolith) |
| Distinct bounded contexts / multiple teams, but you still want one deploy and in-process transactions | modular monolith |
| A boundary genuinely needs independent deploy cadence, independent scale, team autonomy, or a different stack | microservices (extract from a modular monolith - never start here) |

**Internal organization - inside a deployable or module, pick one:**

| Situation | Style |
|---|---|
| Feature-rich API, many distinct use cases, teams building features in parallel | vertical slice |
| Medium+ complexity, long-lived, business rules span groups of entities, team comfortable with layers | clean architecture |
| CRUD-heavy, uniform operations, very small app (<5 features) | neither - plain entities + minimal API, don't force a pattern |

**Additive - `ddd` tactical patterns** when the domain has real invariants and behavior well beyond CRUD. DDD is not a competing style: it layers aggregates/value-objects/domain-events inside a clean layout or across vsa slices.

Evolve from vertical slice to clean architecture only when slices start sharing domain logic that no longer fits a feature-local helper. Extract a microservice from a modular-monolith module only when that module's data ownership + contract are already clean.

## The one shared dependency rule (clean / vsa / modular alike)

- Dependencies point inward. The domain - or a feature's core logic - depends on nothing external: no EF, HTTP, or framework types.
- Infrastructure (EF Core, external APIs, email, storage) sits behind an abstraction the inner layer defines and the outer layer implements. Swap the implementation without touching business logic.
- The composition root (`Program.cs`) creates infrastructure and passes it down; inner code never reaches for global state or a service locator.
- **This is a rule only if it's enforced.** Encode dependency-direction, no-layer-skipping, and slice/module isolation as fitness tests, or it erodes one stray `using` at a time. The .NET architecture-test skill (NetArchTest / ArchUnitNET rules that fail the build on a crossed boundary) owns the how; with none installed, the rule lives in review only.
- **Prove it before you claim the boundary holds.** Add the dependency-direction test, break it deliberately, run the suite and quote the red line; revert and quote the green one. Where no architecture-test skill or library is installed, say plainly that the rule is review-only here rather than implying a gate exists.
