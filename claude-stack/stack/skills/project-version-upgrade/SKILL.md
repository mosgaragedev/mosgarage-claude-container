# Project Version Upgrade - Plan, Approve, Execute (Deliberate)

You drive a breaking version event - framework, runtime, or load-bearing package - from detection to a verified upgrade: enumerate what actually breaks, sequence it foundation-first, get the user's approval on the plan, then execute it stage by stage with a gate after every stage. Judgment runs in-session; the reads and the edits are delegated to the cheap seats. This skill carries NO `model` pin for that judgment, deliberately: a skill-level `model` pin applies only for the rest of the turn in which the skill activates and is not saved to settings, so a multi-turn run returns to the session model (measured: invocations ran on the session model, while agent-level pins in the same session held exactly), so check the session model at run start: when it is not Opus, say so in the first thing the user sees, so the switch to `/model` Opus can happen before the plan is reasoned.

The event kind - framework vs package - is not the user's call to make up front: DETECT reads the manifests and classifies it. The workflow is identical either way; only the breaking-change surface differs. A routine minor/patch bump with no breaking changes needs none of this - say so and exit.

Read `references/upgrade-playbooks.md` before PLAN - the stack-keyed sequencing rules and the runtime-break catalog are this skill's contract, not suggestions.

## Approval gate - and the explicit auto mode

The staged plan is presented and NOTHING is edited until the user approves - an upgrade is consequential. Two answers end the run early: 'just the plan' (exit after PLAN, hand over the plan) and 'stop'.

**Auto mode skips the gate - only when the user explicitly asked for it in the invocation** ('run it in auto mode', '/project-version-upgrade --auto'). Never infer auto from urgency, from a clean plan, or from past runs; absent those words, the gate stands. Auto mode still stops on every hard signal below - it skips the approval pause, not the safety rails. (Side effect worth knowing: an auto run never pauses, so the model the session is on at run start carries the whole run; a gated run can switch at the approval pause and drop to a cheaper model for execution.)

## The run

### 1. DETECT
Green baseline first - build + tests green, zero pending EF migrations, before a single version moves; a red or drifted baseline is a blocking precondition, report it and stop, never plan around it. Then read the manifests (`global.json`, `*.csproj` / `Directory.Packages.props`, `package.json` / `angular.json`), pin current -> target versions and the trigger (major, EOL, security advisory), and classify the event and the stacks it touches. No breaking surface -> routine bump, exit.

### 2. GATHER - delegated
- **The library-docs MCP** (load-bearing - context7 where the project kept it; the baseline comments out the servers a project does not need): the target's published breaking-change surface - the migration guide, deprecations-and-removals, the version delta - never from recall. Without it, the surface is the vendor's migration guide the user pastes or fetches, and a breaking change no doc backs is marked `unverified` in the plan, never asserted. Branch by stack per the playbooks: what the migration engine auto-applies (.NET Upgrade Assistant / `ng update` schematics) versus hand edits.
- **architecture-analyzer (sonnet/medium)** per affected area: where the codebase actually uses the changed/deprecated APIs - located usage digests, reads kept off this context. Mine the build's own signals first (the `[Obsolete]`/analyzer warnings, `ng update`/`ng lint` deprecation notices) - they are the framework's pre-computed removal map.

### 3. PLAN - in-session
Cross the surface against located usage: a breaking change nothing uses is not a task. Split engine-applied vs hand edits. Sequence foundation-first per the playbooks (SDK pin -> TFM -> framework packages in lockstep -> code edits on .NET; one major at a time with `ng update` + the peer matrix on Angular). Each stage carries: its edits, its verification command, its rollback point. Genuinely user-level calls (accept a new major's baseline, drop a deprecated dependency) go to the gate as questions, never guessed. **Hard cap: 2 planning passes.**

### 4. APPROVAL GATE
Present the staged plan, then put the gate through AskUserQuestion as ONE call: 'Approve - execute the stages' (recommended when no user-level question is open), 'Just the plan - exit here, hand over the plan', 'Stop - changes needed'; free text stays available via Other, and the PLAN step's user-level calls join the same call as their own questions (plain-text options where the harness lacks the tool). Auto mode (explicitly requested) proceeds without the pause.

### 5. EXECUTE - stage by stage
Before the first implementer dispatch, write the approval gate file `<docs-path>/flow/APPROVAL` - first line `APPROVED <plan id> - "<the user's words, verbatim>"` from the gate's approving answer, or `AUTO - "<their words, verbatim>"` from the auto-mode invocation - the dispatch hook blocks an unstamped implementer; delete the file when the run completes. Write the stamp at the ABSOLUTE path `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/<docs-path>/flow/APPROVAL` with the Write tool - `.claude/` is a protected path, so the first write in a session prompts; take the prompt's 'allow Claude to edit its own settings for this session' option and the rest of the run is free (no settings key can pre-approve it: `permissions.allow` is not consulted for protected paths); a relative write follows whatever cwd the shell drifted to and the dispatch then bounces. The stamp belongs to the session that dispatches - written when its own decision lands, deleted at its own close; an earlier session's leftover stamp is not consent. If BOTH the Write tool and an absolute-path Bash write are refused by the harness's classifier, stop and put the choice through AskUserQuestion (retry the stamp, or run this stage inline) rather than retrying blind or dispatching around the gate.

Per stage, in the plan's order: dispatch the domain **implementer (sonnet/medium)** with the stage as a scoped brief (trivial manifest bumps: edit inline); run the stage's verification (build + tests); a red routes to the matching **resolver (sonnet/high)** for that stack - the seat covering build errors, or the one covering test failures, matched from your installed agents; with none matching, resolve the red inline and say so; gate green before the next stage. Hard stops, auto mode included: a resolver returning BLOCKED_CONTRACT_CHANGE, a stage that stays red after its resolver pass, or reality contradicting the plan - stop and re-plan, never push through or skip a stage gate.

### 6. VERIFY + REPORT
Full suite green at the end; on a large upgrade, optionally the domain **verifier (sonnet/xhigh)** over the assembled result. Report: current -> target, stages landed and what each changed, runtime-break checks done, anything deferred or user-declined, the rollback points. If the run stopped early: which stage, why, and the state it left. Shaped like:

```
.NET 8 -> 10: 4 stages landed, full suite green (412 passed)
  1 SDK pin + global.json (rollback a1b2c3d)   2 TFM + framework packages in lockstep
  3 engine-applied edits (Upgrade Assistant)   4 hand edits - TimeProvider swap, 3 call sites
runtime-break checks: serializer defaults reviewed, zero [Obsolete] warnings left
deferred: FluentAssertions major (user-declined)
```

## Don't game it
Enumerate the real breaking changes from the framework's own docs, not recall - recall catches the compile break and ships the runtime break. Keep the plan to located usage. Never wave a deprecation off as 'probably fine' - unclear impact is marked to verify. Never weaken a test, suppress a warning, or skip a stage gate to make a stage look green - that is a new break, not progress. Auto mode is the user's word only - proceeding past the gate without it is a protocol violation, not initiative.
