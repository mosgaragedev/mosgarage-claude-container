# Toolkits, UI frameworks under CSP, testing, CI

Loaded from the `browser-extension` skill when scaffolding, choosing tooling, or wiring tests and publishing.

## Toolkits - honest state (mid-2026)

| Tool | State | Pick it when |
|---|---|---|
| **WXT** (default) | Vite-based framework: file-based entrypoints, generated manifest, cross-browser builds (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge, MV2+MV3), best HMR. Pre-1.0 but actively maintained and production-used | almost always - the only actively-maintained cross-browser-first option |
| CRXJS | a Vite *plugin*, minimal abstraction; nearly archived in 2025, revived - current releases with Vite 8 + MAIN-world HMR support | full Vite-config control, Chromium-only scope, no cross-browser need |
| Plasmo | stalled: CLI and sub-packages ~a year without releases, still self-described alpha, Parcel-based with dependency-vuln reports | never for new projects |
| raw Vite/esbuild | hand-rolled manifest, HMR, per-browser builds | very simple extensions or unusual constraints |

Scaffold: `npx wxt@latest init` with TypeScript. Types: `@types/chrome` or `chrome-types` (generated from Chromium source, more current) + the polyfill's or WXT's bundled types. Typed messaging helpers: `@webext-core/messaging` or WXT's own.

## UI frameworks vs the CSP eval wall

Extension pages run under a CSP that forbids `unsafe-eval` - anything compiling templates at runtime breaks:

- **Vue**: runtime-only build + precompiled SFCs (vue-loader). The full build's template compiler uses `new Function` - banned, and dead weight anyway.
- **Angular**: AOT only, never JIT. Works, but heavy for a popup - prefer Svelte/Solid/Preact for lightweight surfaces.
- **Svelte**: AOT by design, generally safe - verify the bundler/babel chain emits no `Function` constructors (known intermittent issue).
- **React**: fine (JSX precompiles); watch bundle size.
- Vue devtools and some HMR paths use eval and error under the CSP - dev-only noise, not a production problem.

## Testing

- **Unit**: Vitest (or Jest) with a mocked chrome API - `@webext-core/fake-browser`, jest-chrome, or sinon-chrome. The real lever is architectural: business logic in plain TS modules that never import `chrome.*` directly.
- **E2E**: Playwright, Chromium only, MV3 only, persistent context only:

  ```ts
  const context = await chromium.launchPersistentContext('', {
    args: [`--disable-extensions-except=${distDir}`, `--load-extension=${distDir}`],
  });
  ```

  Build to a stable dist folder first and pass an ABSOLUTE path; resolve the extension ID dynamically from the service-worker URL, never hardcode it; run headed or use the `chromium` channel for headless.

## CI publishing

Build → test → publish on semver tags. Let the toolkit drive the stores: `wxt submit init` captures the store credentials once (`.env.submit` locally, the same variables as CI secrets) and `wxt submit` pushes the Chrome, Firefox (with the sources zip) and Edge zips in one step. Chrome Web Store auth is a service account on the v2 API - the OAuth client-id/secret/refresh-token flow (v1, what the older community upload actions use) is retired from Oct 2026, so fetch the current auth setup via context7 rather than copying an old recipe; AMO via `web-ext sign` or the AMO API when not on `wxt submit`. Gotcha: a release created by `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not trigger downstream workflows - keep publishing in the same workflow as the release step.
