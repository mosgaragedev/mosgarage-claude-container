# Angular conventions

House rules for Angular, floored at v17 and reaching forward to whatever the workspace is actually on (v20, v21, v22): version-gated idioms name their floor inline, the rest applies from v17 up, and a newer idiom is adopted only when the installed version ships it. The language underneath (strict TypeScript, type modeling, modules, async, error handling, lint and format) is the house TypeScript skill's - load it beside this one; everything here is purely Angular. Material components and the CDK, the broader web index, and the Ionic/Capacitor layer are each their own skill - match them from your skill list by what they cover, and skip any this project did not install. This file is opinion, not reference: it states the choices the team has settled on and the divergences kept on purpose. For any API surface not pinned down here, reach for the `context7` MCP or the Angular CLI MCP (angular.dev content) rather than memory - and never by grepping `node_modules` bundles. The measurements behind these rules live in `references/evidence.md` - an audit appendix, not a run-time load. Version specifics live in per-version delta files - load only the one your workspace is on (`references/v22.md`, `v21.md`, `v20.md`, `v19.md`: stable versus experimental, API spellings and deprecations, the Node.js/TypeScript floor, fact-checked against angular.dev); on v17/v18 there is no delta and this file alone governs.

**The enforceable config lives in `references/angular-style.md`** - the angular-eslint + Prettier flat config, the naming table, modern-vs-legacy examples. A project's own config (`eslint.config.js`, `angular.json`, `.prettierrc`, `.editorconfig`) and its `<docs-path>/PROJECT-CODE-STYLE.md` are higher priority - follow the project where it diverges.

## Standalone is the only module model
- Every component, directive, and pipe is `standalone` - the implicit default from v19, declared explicitly before that. `NgModule` does not appear in new code; the bootstrap is `bootstrapApplication` with an `ApplicationConfig`.
- A component pulls in exactly what its template uses via `imports`. No grab-bag shared module re-exporting half the framework.
- File names follow the v20 style guide - **drop the type suffix** (`order-list.ts`, not `order-list.component.ts`; guards and interceptors hyphenate, `auth-guard.ts`). v19 and earlier keep the classic suffix so `ng update` keeps generating it - migrate organically, never mass-rename. The full naming table is `references/angular-style.md`.
- One responsibility per file; template and styles sit beside the class in the same folder, inlined only for genuinely trivial components. Style scoping and architecture (`ViewEncapsulation`, `:host`, design tokens, responsive, a11y styling) is `angular-styling`.
- Selectors are kebab-case with the project prefix - `app-order-list`, never a bare `order-list` that risks colliding with a third-party tag.
- Keep the container-versus-presentational split honest: containers own data fetching and state, presentational components take inputs and emit outputs and hold no service of their own.

## Signals are the default state primitive
- Local component state is a `signal`; anything derived is a `computed`; side effects that must react to state run in an `effect`. Reach for this before any other mechanism in new code.
- Any state a `computed` or an `effect` reads must itself be a `signal` - no exceptions. A plain class property that feeds a derived value is the reactivity bug to hunt: it is read once at creation and never again, so the derived view silently goes stale. A filter field, a selected id, a search term that narrows a list all qualify (bug and fix side by side: `references/change-detection-and-signals.md`).
- `linkedSignal` (v19+) is writable state derived from a source that should reset when the source moves; `resource` and `rxResource` (v19+) lift async work into signals - read `value()`, `hasValue()`, and `status()` instead of hand-managing loading and error booleans (object forms and the `abortSignal` rule: same reference).

## State management: which tier, and when a store is warranted
The default is the smallest thing that holds the state: local signal -> signal service -> SignalStore -> full NgRx, climbing a tier only when the one below cannot express the need - never to look enterprise. Stores (NgRx, NGXS, a signal-based store) are a last resort for state that truly spans many unrelated features; most state is local and stays in component signals. What each tier is for is `references/state-tiers.md`; load it when shared state outgrows a local signal.

## Server state is not client state
Data that lives on the server (a fetched list, a record by id) is a cache of something you do not own - never copy it into a signal service or a store and babysit it, or two sources of truth drift. Keep it in a dedicated async read primitive that owns loading, error, and freshness - `httpResource` / `resource` / `rxResource` for a screen reading its own data, TanStack Query's Angular adapter once a server cache is shared across views and mutated - and treat reads as cached with a staleness window: a mutation invalidates then refetches, never an optimistic write of the server's shape into a client store. Details in `references/state-tiers.md` - load it before wiring any server read.

## RxJS only where a stream earns it
- Observables are for genuine streams: HTTP responses, debounced input, event buses across components. Never wrap a plain synchronous value in an observable.
- At a template-only boundary, convert with `toSignal` so the view consumes a signal and you avoid the async pipe's subscription bookkeeping.
- Always tear down. Inside a component use `takeUntilDestroyed` (v16+) or the `DestroyRef` it reads from; a manual `Subject` plus `takeUntil` is only acceptable in a class with no injection context.
- Never nest a `subscribe` inside another `subscribe`. Flatten with the higher-order operator whose semantics you actually want - `switchMap` to cancel the previous, `concatMap` to queue, `mergeMap` to run in parallel, `exhaustMap` to ignore while busy - and say why in review when it is not obvious.
- Keep `map` pure. Side effects belong in `tap`.
- Cache a shared stream with `shareReplay({ bufferSize: 1, refCount: true })` so late subscribers get the last value and the source unsubscribes when the audience empties.

## Change detection is always OnPush
- `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` on every component in new code - explicit below v22, the framework default from v22 (which renamed the old `Default` strategy `Eager` and deprecated the old name). An eagerly-checked component is a bug unless a library's own docs require it - then keep it on `Eager` (`Default` below v22) and cite the requirement inline.
- Feed components immutable data through signal inputs - `input()` and `input.required<T>()` - emit with `output()`, and bind two-way state with `model()` (v17.2+). The decorator `@Input` and `@Output` survive only in code predating 17.1; never mix the two styles in one component.
- Drive the view with signals or observables, not a hand-placed `markForCheck`. If you are reaching for `ChangeDetectorRef`, the state shape is wrong.
- OnPush is the stepping stone to zoneless, not the destination. Where the installed version ships stable zoneless change detection (v20.2+, the default for new apps from v21) AND every framework layer in the app supports it (a layer that still requires `zone.js` keeps it - that framework's skill owns the call), drop `zone.js` and bootstrap with `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` plus `provideBrowserGlobalErrorListeners()`. Every update must then flow through a signal or `AsyncPipe`; the dev-first migration order is in `references/change-detection-and-signals.md`.

## Templates carry no logic
- A template holds simple expressions only. Push any real computation into a `computed` signal; never call a method from the template, since it re-runs every change-detection pass.
- Use block control flow - `@if`, `@for`, `@switch` - in place of the old structural directives. Give every `@for` over an object collection a `track` expression keyed on a stable identity.
- Defer below-the-fold and non-critical content with `@defer`. Pick the trigger on purpose - `on viewport`, `on idle`, `on interaction` - and always supply a `@placeholder` so nothing reflows when the block resolves.
- Static images go through `NgOptimizedImage`; mark the above-the-fold hero `priority` so the LCP image preloads and its box is reserved, killing layout shift.
- No `@angular/animations` DSL in new code - it is deprecated: use the native `animate.enter` / `animate.leave` bindings and plain CSS transitions, and plan existing DSL animations off it. Route transitions use `withViewTransitions()` - except inside an Ionic `IonRouterOutlet`, whose own stack transitions it fights (page transitions there belong to the skill covering the Ionic/Capacitor layer; with none installed, keep `withViewTransitions()` off that outlet and say why inline).

## SSR and hydration
Web targets only - a Capacitor WebView has no server render, so skip this in an Ionic native app. SSR project: the rules are in `references/ssr-hydration.md` - Read it before touching server rendering, hydration, or any code that runs during the server pass (browser globals, non-deterministic output, the transfer cache).

## Services and dependency injection
- App-wide singletons declare `providedIn: 'root'` so they tree-shake when unused and need no module registration.
- Pick `inject()` or constructor injection and hold to it per project; `inject()` is the recommendation in new code because it composes cleanly in functions, guards, and base classes.
- Depend on an interface or an injection token, not a concrete class, so a feature can be tested and re-provided without editing its consumers.

## HTTP, routing, and forms
- Keep endpoint URLs in one config service or environment file, never scattered as string literals.
- Cross-cutting HTTP concerns - auth headers, retry, error normalization - live in functional interceptors registered with `withInterceptors`, not in each call site.
- Typed reactive forms (`FormGroup<T>`) are the default; on v22+ prefer Signal Forms for new forms (`form()` from `@angular/forms/signals`, stable there - experimental on v21, so version-tag any use). Template-driven forms are only for trivial throwaway inputs, and no field is ever typed or defaulted as `null`.
- Lazy-load feature routes with `loadComponent` for standalone targets, falling back to `loadChildren` only where legacy modules remain.
- Bind route params and `data` straight into component `input()`s with `withComponentInputBinding()` instead of injecting `ActivatedRoute` and reading snapshots.
- Resolve a route's critical data ahead of activation with a thin `resolve` guard that delegates to a service, so the component renders without a request waterfall. Not in an Ionic app: cached pages never re-activate on revisit, so a resolver never re-runs and ships stale data - refresh on `ionViewWillEnter` there - ground the skill covering the Ionic/Capacitor layer owns, and with none installed this rule is the whole guidance.
- Validation is a layer, not a pile of one-off checks: rules declared on the model, reusable pure `ValidatorFn`s, cross-field rules on the group, async validators that debounce and cancel, ONE shared error surface - never a per-template error wall. The full strategy (Signal Forms and Standard Schema included) is `references/forms-validation.md`; load it before building any non-trivial form.

## Accessibility
- Every interactive element is reachable by keyboard and shows a visible focus indicator.
- Reach for semantic HTML first - `<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>` - and add ARIA only when no native element expresses the intent.
- For custom widgets (accordion, listbox, combobox, menu, tabs, and more), build on the headless `@angular/aria` directives (developer preview in v21, stable from v22): they own the keyboard, focus, and ARIA state machine; you supply the markup and styles, hung off the aria-expanded / aria-selected / aria-current attributes they manage. Check `angular.dev/guide/aria` for the current roster and never reimplement that logic.
- Text contrast meets WCAG AA - exact ratios are `angular-styling`'s to state.

On greenfield or visual work, load `references/design-quality.md` before the first screen goes in - the type scale, spacing rhythm, color system, motion and per-state rules that keep a UI from reading as a framework default. Skip it when you are reproducing a fixed design or Figma handoff faithfully. It owns the *taste*; the mechanism lives in the styling skill (CSS, tokens, responsive) and, where the project uses Material, the theming skill.
## Feature boundaries
- Features may depend on `shared/` and `core/` but never on one another. No import from `features/billing` reaches into `features/orders`. (How barrels and deep imports are policed is `typescript`.)
- Anything two features must share crosses through a service in `core/` or a state store, never a direct component reference.

## Performance budgets
These are gates for the web/PWA target - a Capacitor binary loads its bundle from disk and has no SEO, so in an Ionic app apply them only to the web build.
- Hold the initial bundle under 500 KB gzipped; lazy-load whatever would push past it.
- Encode the ceiling as `budgets` in `angular.json` so a regression fails the build rather than slipping through review.
- Clear Lighthouse 90+ on Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO before any production release.

## Testing
- Test practice is `angular-testing`'s - load it before writing, changing, or reviewing tests; this skill keeps only the convention below.
- Bake automated accessibility checks into component specs - a11y is a convention gate here, not just a test technique. The matcher package follows the workspace's runner (`angular-testing` owns runner routing): `jest-axe` on Jest, `vitest-axe` on Vitest, raw `axe-core` (`axe.run` on the fixture element) under Karma/Jasmine - never mandate a matcher the installed runner cannot load.
- Before calling an Angular change done, run the workspace build and the specs covering the files you touched, and quote both result lines. A build that was never run is not a green build.

## Banned patterns
- No `setTimeout` poked in to coax change detection into noticing a change - it only 'works' because zone.js patches timers to trigger a render, so it papers over a broken signal/input flow and silently stops working under zoneless. Fix the flow instead.
- No direct DOM mutation outside a directive - the server has no browser DOM and a hand-mutated node is the classic hydration-mismatch error, and a raw `innerHTML` write skips Angular's sanitizer; go through `Renderer2`.
- No method calls in template expressions - they re-run on every change-detection pass; bind a `computed` instead.
- No `null` field defaults in forms - a `null` default widens the typed control to `T | null` and leaks null checks into every consumer.
- No decorator queries or host bindings in new code - `viewChild()`/`contentChild()` return signals that compose with `computed` and `effect`, and the `host` object replaces `@HostBinding`/`@HostListener`, which Angular keeps only for backwards compatibility.

## Reward-hacking shortcuts to reject
The recurring ways a change fakes a green build or suite instead of earning it - reject each in review, whoever wrote it. This is the one consolidated list to check a diff against before claiming done; the language-level bans (`any`, `@ts-ignore`, non-null `!`) live in `typescript`.

The shortcut-by-shortcut table is `references/reward-hacking.md` - read it before claiming a change is done.
