description: "JavaScript language conventions, framework-agnostic - the base layer for all JS-family code. Load before writing or editing any .js, .jsx, .mjs, or .cjs file in any runtime - browser, Node, build script, service worker, extension. Covers ES modules only, named exports and boundary barrels, async/await discipline with cancellation, the two failure channels (returned result vs thrown Error), modern-feature adoption (structuredClone, iterator helpers, Temporal), untrusted-input rules, naming and shape. The type layer (TypeScript, and checked JS via JSDoc) stacks on this baseline in the type-conventions skill where the project has one; frameworks add their own layer above that. Not for C#/.NET or other languages."

# JavaScript conventions - the base language layer

For any runtime or package API surface not pinned down here, reach for the `context7` MCP rather than memory - never by grepping `node_modules` bundles (measured: one session spent ~5.2k tokens grep/sed-ing a minified package for an answer the live MCP held; the routing line lived only in a router skill this leaf never loads).

These are the language rules for every piece of JS-family code, independent of where it runs. The TypeScript type-layer skill stacks on top of this baseline and owns everything type-system: strict flags, type modeling, and checked-JS-via-JSDoc. A framework adds its own layer above that. **A project's own config and its `<docs-path>/PROJECT-CODE-STYLE.md` are higher priority - follow the project where it diverges.**

## Modules and imports

- ES modules only - `import` / `export`. No CommonJS `require` in new code, save for a `.cjs` interop shim. Set `"type": "module"` wherever the runtime allows it. The current mechanics - `require(esm)`, import attributes, the dual-package hazard - are `references/modern-runtime.md`, along with the shipped-feature catalog (iterator helpers, Set methods, `structuredClone`, Temporal for all new date work) that replaces the lodash-era idioms.
- Named exports by default; they keep one canonical name and survive renames. Reserve `export default` for the entry points a framework or bundler demands.
- Expose a package - or a feature wide enough to have a public surface - through a single index barrel at its boundary, and import through that barrel from outside. Barrels stop there: no deep intra-feature barrels (they hurt build/lint/test performance and invite cycles). Inside a feature, deep relative imports are fine; reaching past another feature's barrel is not.

## Async

- `async`/`await` over `.then()` chains; no floating promise - every promise awaited, returned, or explicitly `void`ed with a comment. A dropped rejection is an unhandled error you'll only find in production.
- `Promise.all` for independent work instead of serialized awaits in a loop.
- Thread an `AbortSignal` through cancellable I/O - fetch, timers, sockets - and wire it to teardown (component destroy, request abort, worker lifecycle). Cancellation is part of the contract, not an afterthought.
- No `async` function as a `new Promise(...)` executor - a rejection inside it vanishes. Wrap a legacy callback API exactly once in a `promisify`-style helper and use that everywhere.
- Composition semantics (`allSettled` vs `all`), the single-use-signal gotcha, `Error.cause` chaining, retry/backoff with idempotency, and stream/event-loop discipline: `references/async-patterns.md`.

## The two failure channels

- **Expected, recoverable outcomes** - not found, validation rejected, a conflict - are return values, not exceptions: a result object the call site branches on (`{ ok: true, value } | { ok: false, error }`). The failure stays visible in the signature instead of hidden in a `throw`.
- **Unexpected failures** - a bug, a broken invariant, a dependency that's down - throw. Always an `Error` (or subclass, one per distinct failure mode), never a string or plain object; `instanceof` and stack traces depend on it. Chain the original: `new AppError('upstream failed', { cause: err })`.
- Never swallow. An empty `catch`, or one that logs and limps onward, hides the failure. Handle it specifically or rethrow.

## Untrusted input

- Never merge untrusted input into objects with a recursive merge or spread without guarding `__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype` keys - prototype pollution is the precondition gadget for a lot of downstream exploits. `Map` (or `Object.create(null)`) over plain objects for untrusted keys.
- Validate `event.origin` in every `postMessage` handler; treat cross-context messages as input, not as calls.
- No `eval`, `new Function`, or string-based `setTimeout` - there is always a data-shaped alternative.

## Naming and shape of code

- camelCase for values and functions, PascalCase for classes and constructors, UPPER_CASE for true constants; boolean predicates read as questions (`isReady`, `hasItems`). No abbreviations past the universally understood ones (`id`, `url`, `http`).
- A function does one thing. Prefer pure functions and early returns to deep nesting; a flat function with guard clauses is easier to read and to test than a pyramid.
- `const` / `let`, never `var`. `===` / `!==`, never `==`. No implicit globals.

## Tooling

- Default test runner for plain JS/TS projects: **Vitest** (ESM-first, Jest-compatible API) - jest only where the project already signals it (existing jest config/deps, CRA, a monorepo sibling on jest); `node:test` is the zero-dependency floor for small libraries. Frameworks bring their own harness and win in their own projects.
- Performance work - Core Web Vitals in the browser, the never-block-the-event-loop discipline in Node, and the profiling toolbox - is `references/performance.md`; measure before optimizing.
- Lint and format per the project's own config; in a TypeScript project the TypeScript type-layer skill's style reference owns the concrete setup.
- Before any done word: run the project's lint and its test command over what you changed and quote both result lines. A JS change that was never executed is a change nobody has run - the language gives you no compiler to catch it.
