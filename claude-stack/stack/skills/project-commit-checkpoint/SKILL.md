# Commit checkpoint - the gate before a commit or a publish

The protocol `baseline-git.md` points at: what runs before a non-trivial commit, the exemptions, the receipt the `guard-ungated-commit` hook reads at commit time, and the same ceremony for `git push` / `gh pr merge`. It lived inside the always-on rule until 0.2.71 and every session paid its 6.6k chars on every message; now it loads when a commit or a publish is the next act, or when the hook's denial names it. The commit-message shape and the branch discipline stay in the rule. The measurements behind these rules live in `references/evidence.md` - an audit appendix, not a run-time load.

## Pre-commit checkpoint


On any non-trivial diff, before committing or presenting: run the formatter, then the house
review `project-verify-code` - model-invocable, so the gate holds in autonomous flows too
(`/code-review` is a user-run parallel sweep, not this gate; `/simplify` applies its quality
findings in place) - plus the security review below when the diff touches auth, crypto, secrets,
payment or data-access paths (`baseline-security.md` owns the trigger), plus any diff gates named
in the project's `CLAUDE.md` - then satisfy the Definition-of-done gate. Findings caught here land in the same
commit; found later they become fixup noise or shipped defects. Skip for typos / one-line /
formatting-only diffs - and for a diff an equivalent-or-stronger check just cleared: the active
quality-loop's own dispatched re-verify plus final gate, or the cross-task flow's domain-verifier
sign-offs plus the integration-reviewer final gate (a self-granted skip on any other reasoning
is not this exemption; the security half has its own narrower carve-out, below). The review half may also run as a DISPATCHED domain-verifier pass over
exactly this diff - the right call when the session's carried context is already heavy, since the
seat reviews from a clean context - and its sign-off satisfies the checkpoint the same way. Either
way the review is a real invocation THIS session: a receipt claiming 'project-verify-code inline'
with no Skill call in the transcript is a replay from memory, not the gate. The formatter half is never skipped, and it must be FRESH: a formatter
run from earlier in the session does not cover files edited since - re-run it after the last
edit, before the commit. One unformatted
commit is a red CI run and a fixup commit. A quality-loop stage-boundary commit may
exceed the one-logical-change size guidance when its stages share touched files - name the stages
in the commit body rather than splitting an unverifiable diff.

### The security half

`baseline-security.md` owns the trigger (crypto / secret / auth / payment / data-access work), the
honesty rules and the `VERIFIED` bar; this is how the review runs. **Do the scoped review yourself,
first:** compute `git diff HEAD` (or the staged diff, or `git diff <base>..HEAD` for a range) and
apply the vulnerability checklist to exactly that - a read-only general-purpose seat where dispatch
exists, inline otherwise, and inline inside a stamped flow where the dispatch guard blocks generic
seats. Feed it the FULL change set with the reset chained into the SAME call, the spelling that rule
carries, so untracked files appear in the diff and the intent-to-add entries never outlive it.

`/security-review` is the UNBOUNDED route, and the bound is not yours to set: it recomputes a
whole-branch diff whatever base it is handed, so an explicit base does not scope it, and a branch
level with origin on a clean tree overflows the same way - 'long-lived branch' is not the trigger
either. Reach for it only when the whole branch really is the review scope and the diff is small.

The checkpoint exemption above skips this half only when the gate that cleared the diff carried a
security pass - the integration-reviewer gate does, the quality loop's does not, so a loop diff on
these paths still runs the review before `VERIFIED`.

The checkpoint ends by writing its receipt: `<docs-path>/flow/COMMIT-GATE`, five lines -

```
VERIFIED <what was reviewed, one phrase>
authorized: "<the user's words asking for THIS commit, verbatim>"
head: <the sha the review ran against>
spec: <N files - the set it covered>
live-probe: <what was actually run, or NOT RUN - <reason>>
```

(the quality-loop and cross-task gate exemptions count as VERIFIED - name the loop or gate); or
`WAIVED - "<the user's words, verbatim>"` alone on their explicit waiver - 'commit it' is an
instruction to commit, never a waiver of the review. Each line answers a way the receipt once
passed while recording nothing: the VERIFIED line proves the review ran, `authorized:`
proves the user asked, `head:` proves it reviewed THIS tree, `spec:` proves it covered the whole
diff and `live-probe:` proves it ran the thing. The quoted words
must carry a commit verb and must not be an
option label this run wrote: consent given by picking an option is spelled `answered: <the chosen
label>` instead, which is a different claim and reads as one. A review carried from an earlier
cycle says so: `carried: <cycle id>, reviewed <date>`.
Write the receipt as its OWN tool call, before the call that runs `git commit` - the enforcing
hook checks the file at commit time, so a receipt written inside the same compound command is
invisible to a stricter gate and unauditable in the ledger. The shipped hook still ACCEPTS the atomic
write+commit shape (blocking it would reject the receipt discipline itself), so nothing stops you
mechanically - which is exactly why the rule is the binding one. Own-call receipt, then
the commit, then clear it. The `guard-ungated-commit` hook
blocks a non-trivial `git commit` without a fresh receipt. The hook
judges 'trivial' mechanically - at most 2 files and 15 changed lines - so a prose-exempt diff
above that bar (a formatting-only sweep) still writes `VERIFIED` naming the exemption; never
split a real change into small commits to slip under it. Clear the file once the commit lands -
after the LAST commit when one receipt covers a reviewed batch - a leftover receipt is the stale-stamp failure the hook's 2h age
cap exists for. A commit in a second tree this session may write (the cross-project guard's own
allowance, for a tree the project owns) gets its own receipt in THAT tree's docs root, written and
cleared the same way; a sibling repo is never committed, branched, pushed or PR'd from
here - its change is a task card under `<docs-path>/cross-project-tasks/`, and it is never OFFERED
as an option in an ask of the run's own making. The one place it IS offered is the guard's own
denial - 'Allow writes into <root> for this session', never the recommended option - and only
because that answer is honoured: it writes the `<docs-path>/flow/CROSS-WRITE-ALLOW` receipt (one
root per line; this session's own, under 8h) that the guard reads before it judges.

**Discarding uncommitted work has the same receipt shape.** `git checkout --` / `restore` /
`reset --hard` / `clean -f` over a DIRTY path is blocked, and the denial's three-option ask (keep,
recommended / discard / narrow to one file) is the user's to answer - never yours. Only after they
answer 'Discard it', never pre-emptively, write `<docs-path>/flow/DISCARD-ALLOW` - one path per line
spelled exactly as the blocked command spells them, or a single `*` for everything; this session's
own, under 8h - and then retry the SAME command.

**Publishing has the same ceremony.** `git push` and `gh pr merge` are where the work leaves this
machine - other people and CI get it, and a shared branch cannot be un-pushed quietly - so they
carry their own receipt, `<docs-path>/flow/PUSH-GATE`, in the SAME five-line shape - `VERIFIED
<what is being published, one phrase>`, `authorized: "<the user's words asking for THIS publish,
verbatim>"`, `head:`, `spec: <the commit set going out>` and `live-probe:` - or `WAIVED - "<their
words>"`. Only the spec differs in kind: a publish's spec names what LEAVES the machine, not what
is uncommitted here, so it is required and never counted against the working tree. Say what is going out and to which branch, get the answer, write the
receipt as its own call, publish, clear it. `guard-ungated-commit` enforces this half too. A push
that publishes nothing - a dry run, or a branch already level with its upstream - is never gated,
and a repo whose remote is already gated by branch protection or a required review turns the half
off for good with `CLAUDE_STACK_PUSH_GATE=0` in the settings.json env block.
