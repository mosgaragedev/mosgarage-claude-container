# Angular Material / CDK version deltas (v20-v22)

`SKILL.md` floors at v17 and its theming section needs v19+; these are the version deltas that bite. Adopt each only where the installed version ships it.

- **Before v19:** the single-mixin `mat.theme` API does not exist. v17-v18 use the experimental `mat.define-theme` predecessor, so the theming section of `SKILL.md` does not apply as written - upgrade to v19+ before following it, or theme through `mat.define-theme` and say plainly that the house theming rules were not applied.

- **Button directives (v20):** the `mat-button` family is now the `matButton` attribute - bare `matButton` for text, plus `matButton="elevated" | "filled" | "outlined" | "tonal"` (the M3 `tonal` variant sits between filled and outlined). `matIconButton` gains `filled` / `tonal` too, and cards take `appearance="filled"`. Update the old `mat-raised-button` / `mat-flat-button` / `mat-stroked-button` selectors when you touch them - they are deprecated, not deleted.
- **Raw token rename (v20):** the per-component custom properties dropped the old `--mdc-*` prefix for `--mat-*` (e.g. `--mdc-outlined-card-container-shape` became `--mat-card-outlined-container-shape`). Run `ng generate @angular/material:token-rename` on upgrade - and keep binding the overrides mixin or a `--mat-sys-*` system token, never these raw properties by hand (SKILL.md's rule).
- **Reduced motion (v20):** Material honors the prefers-reduced-motion media query on its own animations - do not hand-gate motion you got from a component.
- **FocusTrap (v21, breaking):** the injector parameter became required on the `FocusTrap` / `ConfigurableFocusTrap` constructors, and `ConfigurableFocusTrapFactory.create`'s boolean argument became a config object. The `cdkTrapFocus` directive is unaffected - prefer it.
- **Angular Aria (v21 developer preview, stable in v22):** `@angular/aria` is a headless, unstyled a11y primitive set (Accordion, Combobox, Grid, Listbox, Menu, Tabs, Toolbar, Tree at launch) that overlaps parts of the CDK. Reach for it when you need unstyled primitives to build your own component; keep the styled Material / CDK components as the default for standard UI.
- **CDK overlays (v21):** the `Overlay` service now builds on the browser-native Popover API with per-side viewport margins; the service API you call is unchanged.
