name: dev-log-convert
description: "Converts a day's raw work notes (Ukrainian, English, or mixed) into a structured, past-tense English work log - ticket IDs normalized, time totalled, tasks grouped by project or prefix across one or more days. Fires only on the exact keyword 'dev-log' - do not use it for general note-taking, meeting minutes, commit messages, or status updates, which are not this format."
---

You will receive text (Ukrainian, English, or mixed) describing work done during one or more days. Convert it into a concise English work log written in past tense.

## Ticket IDs

A ticket ID matches the pattern `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*-\d+` (one or more uppercase letters/digits, a dash, then digits). Examples: `ABC-123`, `PROJ7-4521`.

- Output ticket IDs in uppercase, even if the input used lowercase.
- Silently correct obvious typos in prefixes (e.g. transposed letters) when surrounding tickets in the same input make the intended prefix unambiguous.
- If a task has no ticket, use `Other` as the ticket ID.

## Output format

### Single-prefix day

When all ticketed tasks in a day share the same prefix (or there are no tickets at all), use a flat list:

```
Log of work <dd.mm.yyyy>.

<Day of week>:
1 <TICKET-ID> (<time>) - <Summary sentence(s).>
2 <TICKET-ID> (<time>) - <Summary sentence(s).>
3 Other (<time>) - <Summary.>
Total time: <sum>.
```

### Multi-prefix day

When ticketed tasks in a day use two or more different prefixes, group them. Numbering restarts within each group.

```
Log of work <dd.mm.yyyy>.

<Day of week>:

<GROUP_LABEL_1>:
1 <TICKET-ID> (<time>) - <Summary.>
2 Other (<time>) - <Summary.>

<GROUP_LABEL_2>:
1 <TICKET-ID> (<time>) - <Summary.>

Total time: <sum across all groups>.
```

**Group label rules**
- If the input explicitly names a project for a set of tasks (e.g. 'Today on ProjectX:' or 'ProjectX - APV49-...'), use that name as the group label.
- Otherwise, use the ticket prefix itself as the label.
- If the input declares that several distinct prefixes belong to one project, treat them as one group under that project name.
- `Other` items go under the group whose tasks they were mentioned alongside in the input. If `Other` items have no clear group, place them under a final `Other` group.

**Ordering**
- Order groups by total time spent that day, largest first.
- Within a group: ticketed tasks first (largest time first), then `Other` items.
- The date in the title is today's date in `dd.mm.yyyy` format - for single-day input with no date of its own; a dated or multi-day input takes each entry's resolved date (see Multiple days and Edge cases).

## Rules

**Language**
- Default output language is English.
- If the input is entirely in English, keep the output in English.
- If the input is in Ukrainian or mixed Ukrainian/English, translate everything to English by default.
- If the user explicitly asks to keep the output in Ukrainian (e.g. 'keep in Ukrainian', 'залиш українською', 'не перекладай', 'output in Ukrainian'), produce the log in Ukrainian instead. In that case, translate any English fragments in the input to Ukrainian for consistency. This preference applies only to the current request unless the user says otherwise.
- Never use Russian under any circumstances.
- Use past tense only.
- Each task summary is 1-2 short sentences.
- Use a normal dash `-` instead of an em dash.
- Use straight double quotes `" "` only - do not use curly quotes.
- Replace semicolons with a full stop and start a new sentence.

**Line format**
- Ticket ID comes first on each task line, then time in brackets, then dash, then summary.

**Time**
- Normalize time to `h` for hours and `m` for minutes (e.g. `2h`, `30m`, `1h 30m`).
- Accept Ukrainian variants in input: `г`, `год`, `гг`, `хв`, `хвил` - treat as hours/minutes accordingly.
- Accept decimal hours in input and convert: `0.25h` → `15m`, `0.5h` → `30m`, `0.75h` → `45m`, `1.25h` → `1h 15m`, `2.5h` → `2h 30m`.
- If time is not provided for a task, write `(time not specified)`.
- DERIVED time is never invented: when the input gives a total or an estimate that the output shape must SPLIT per day or per task, stop and ask (AskUserQuestion) for the real split before drafting any dated log (measured: an unasked 8h/8h/5h+3h/8h split cost four correction round-trips, with the ask finally firing after the third). A task with no time given at all simply takes `(time not specified)` - the placeholder covers a missing figure, the ask covers an invented split.
- Multi-ticket day granularity: one entry per ticket is not a safe default - mirror the granularity of the user's prior day-entries in the same log, and where no precedent exists, ask via AskUserQuestion (measured: a two-ticket day drafted per-ticket was rejected for merged wording).
- Self-check before output: write the drafted task lines of each day to a file inside the session's own scratch directory (never the project tree, never outside it), then run them through `scripts/total-time.js` (`node scripts/total-time.js < <that file>` - Node.js built-ins only, nothing to install) and confirm its total equals the printed `Total time`; it normalizes the h/m, Ukrainian and decimal-hour spellings and counts a `(time not specified)` line as zero. On a mismatch, take the script's total - never print an unverified sum. Where the script cannot be run, re-add the times by hand and say the check was manual.

**Task grouping within a day**
- Keep only the main points - no extra explanations, no step-by-step process.
- Merge or group similar items so each day has only the key tasks.
- If the same ticket appears multiple times in one day, keep separate lines if they represent different work blocks or branches; otherwise merge them and sum the time.
- Pure non-work entries that aren't a ticket and aren't a recurring item (lunch, coffee break): omit entirely. Private life is not in the log.
- Before drafting the first day, read `references/edge-cases.md` - the completion signals, the implicit-investigation sentence, and the edge cases (relative dates, a ticket spanning days, a day off, a time mismatch). They fire on the shape of the input, so a run that skips them drafts the wrong shape and gets corrected.

**Multiple days**
- If input contains multiple days, output each day as a separate section in the same response.
- Each day's section title carries that day's own resolved date - the today's-date title rule applies to single-day input only.
- If a day of week is not provided, write `Day not specified`.

## When the raw material is a repo, not notes

Some runs arrive with no notes - 'write the log for what I did this week', or an effort estimate -
and the work has to be read off the repository. Three rules, each from a measured miss:

- **The opening survey is ONE capped pass.** `git status --short`, `git stash list`, and
  `git diff <base>...HEAD --stat` come first; a full diff is read per file off that stat, never as
  one uncapped dump. Measured: two uncapped `git diff HEAD` calls cost 10.3k tokens for an estimate
  a capped survey answered for ~4.3k in a sibling session, same repo, same task shape.
- **`git stash list` is part of that survey**, beside `git status` and `git diff`. Measured: a
  change analysis and effort estimate built from the branch diff and the working tree alone was
  WRONG on scope until the user asked about the stash, and the recovery diffs cost ~9.8k.
- **A SECOND correction on the same axis is an ask, not a third redraft.** When two consecutive
  free-text corrections land on one axis - granularity, the time split, wording - stop regenerating
  and put that axis through ONE AskUserQuestion carrying the options the two corrections imply.
  Measured: two corrections on one axis were each answered with a fresh regeneration.

## Style guidance

Open each summary with a past-tense verb, and render recurring non-ticket items (standups, weekly calls, merge request review - always `Other`) in a consistent canonical form matched to the input phrasing. The preferred verb openers and the canonical-form patterns: `references/style-guidance.md`.

## Examples

### Example 1 - single prefix, Ukrainian input

Input:
> Понеділок: ABC-1319 - 2г досліджував проблему з ротацією культур по ID поля, виправив обробку відсутніх записів, протестував. ABC-1320 - 30хв створив merge request. Нарада з командою - 1г.

Output:
```
Log of work 13.04.2026.

Monday:
1 ABC-1319 (2h) - Investigated a crop rotation issue by field ID. Fixed missing record handling. Testing.
2 ABC-1320 (30m) - Created a merge request.
3 Other (1h) - Attended team meeting.
Total time: 3h 30m.
```

More worked examples - a multi-prefix day grouped by ticket prefix, and a multi-project day with explicit labels: `references/examples.md`.

## Output presentation

Always wrap the final log in a fenced code block (triple backticks, no language tag). This ensures formatting markup is visible and a copy button appears in the UI.
