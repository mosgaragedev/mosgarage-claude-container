# DevOps - containers, CI/CD, and safe deploys for the .NET/Angular house

For any action, image, or tool flag not pinned down here, resolve it with the `context7` MCP rather than memory (the routing lesson from a sibling leaf: the MCP sat live and unused because the routing line lived only in a router skill this leaf never loads).

The pipeline is production code - a broken workflow blocks every merge and a leaked secret is an incident, not a warning. This is the delivery-surface map for the house stacks (ASP.NET Core, Angular, and their SQL/data layer). It pairs with whichever of these the project installed - the skill covering local cloud-native orchestration, the one covering the .NET migration workflow, and the ones covering application- and data-layer hardening (crypto primitives are a fourth). With none of them present, the rules here are the whole guidance and any check they would have run is reported UNVERIFIED. The rule under all of it - the build is reproducible, the secret never touches an image or a log, and every deploy is reversible.

## Docker - reproducible, minimal, non-root

- Multi-stage build - an SDK stage compiles and publishes, a slim runtime stage copies only the published output; the SDK image never ships.
- Order the layers for the cache - copy the project and lock files and restore BEFORE copying the source, so a source edit does not bust the restore layer. A Dockerfile that copies everything then restores never hits the cache.
- Mount a persistent package cache in the restore layer - `RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages dotnet restore` (and the npm cache) - so the cache survives even when the copy-lockfile-then-restore layer is busted.
- When a build genuinely needs a secret - a private NuGet-feed PAT during restore - pass it with `RUN --mount=type=secret,id=...` so it never lands in a layer or image history, distinct from the runtime secrets pulled from the store.
- Pin the base image by digest, never a floating :latest or a bare major tag - a moving tag makes the build non-reproducible and is a supply-chain hole. Prefer a chiseled or distroless .NET runtime image (no shell, minimal CVE surface).
- Pin the BuildKit frontend on the Dockerfile's first line - `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` (to a digest for a fully locked build) - so an untrusted or moving frontend cannot run build-time code you never vetted; and treat `buildx` `--sbom` / `--provenance` attestations as metadata, not signatures - sign the image with cosign if you need provenance you can verify.
- Build multi-arch images with `buildx --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` when developers are on Apple Silicon but production runs x64 - a locally-built image is otherwise the wrong architecture for the server.
- Run as a non-root USER, mount the root filesystem read-only where the app allows, and keep a .dockerignore that excludes bin, obj, node_modules, .git, and every secret-bearing file.
- Harden past non-root at runtime - drop all Linux capabilities, set no-new-privileges, cap memory / CPU / PID count, and keep the default seccomp profile plus an AppArmor or SELinux profile instead of reaching for `--privileged`, so a compromised or leaking process cannot escalate, exhaust PIDs, or starve the host. The full checklist with the compose keys: `references/docker-hardening.md`.
- Give the container a HEALTHCHECK and proper PID-1 signal handling (an init shim) so the orchestrator can tell ready from dead and a SIGTERM drains rather than kills.

The shape in one Dockerfile - multi-stage, cache-ordered, digest-pinned, non-root:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0@sha256:<digest> AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["App/App.csproj", "App/"]
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages dotnet restore App/App.csproj
COPY . .
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages dotnet publish App/App.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0-noble-chiseled@sha256:<digest>
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
USER $APP_UID
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "App.dll"]
```

## Compose - local topology, not a secret store

- Express service dependencies with a health condition, and give every backing service (Postgres, SQL Server, Redis) its own healthcheck, so a dependent waits for ready and not merely started.
- Keep state in named volumes; never bind-mount or inline a secret in the compose file - pull it from a gitignored env-file that never enters source control.
- Segment the network - put backing services on an `internal: true` network with no published host ports, expose only the edge service and bind its port to `127.0.0.1` rather than `0.0.0.0`, and give each service only the networks it needs - two services that never talk share no network - so a compromised service cannot reach the rest. Before reaching for a driver-level switch to do it, read the inter-container-traffic section of `references/docker-hardening.md`: the obvious knobs do not mean what they look like.

## GitHub Actions - the CI/CD contract

- Structure the graph - a lint/build job and a test job sequenced with needs, fail-fast on lint so a formatting break does not burn a full test run. A matrix covers multiple target frameworks or Node versions.
- Key the cache on a lockfile hash (packages.lock.json, yarn.lock) with restore-keys for partial hits; a cache key that ignores the lockfile serves a stale restore. Restore deterministically - restore in locked mode, npm ci, never a floating install.
- Pin every third-party action to a full commit SHA, not a moving major tag - the tag is mutable, and a compromised action runs with your token.
- Handle secrets as GitHub Secrets only; mask any derived secret before it can reach a log, never echo one, and set a least-privilege permissions block (default read, elevate per job). Federate to the cloud with OIDC (short-lived) rather than a long-lived stored credential.
- Run integration tests against real service containers, not a mock - a suite green against a stub proves nothing about the wired system.
- Add a security-scan stage past the dependency audit - a secret scanner (gitleaks) failing the build on a committed credential, and a Trivy scan of the built image gating CRITICAL/HIGH; run the dependency + image scans on a cron schedule off the PR path too, so a CVE disclosed against an already-merged clean dependency is still caught.
- Set timeout-minutes on every job so a hung step is killed in minutes instead of burning the runner's full default budget.
- Add a concurrency group keyed on workflow + ref with cancel-in-progress: true, so a fast follow-up push cancels the now-stale run instead of queueing behind it.
- Upload diagnostic artifacts on failure only (if: failure()) - test results and logs with a short retention - so a red run is debuggable without a rerun.

## Prove the pipeline change

A workflow that parses is not a workflow that runs. Before any done word on a change here, quote three result lines: `docker build` on the Dockerfile you touched (an image that does not build is the whole finding), the workflow linter on the workflow you touched, and the secret scanner over the diff. Where one of the three is not installed, say which and report that leg UNVERIFIED rather than skipping it silently.

## Deploy and release - reversible and health-gated

- Promote one immutable artifact through the environments (with required reviewers on prod); never rebuild per environment, or you ship something you never tested.
- Run migrations as a discrete, gated step BEFORE the app rolls, expand-then-contract so the old and new app versions both work mid-deploy (mechanics belong to the skill covering the .NET migration workflow, where the install has it; without it, keep the step gated and reversible from here); every deploy carries a rollback path.
- Cut over health-gated - blue-green, or a rolling update behind readiness checks, never a big-bang replace that routes traffic to a not-ready instance.
- Pull config and secrets at runtime from the store (Key Vault, an OIDC-federated secret) - never bake them into the image (the app- and data-layer hardening skills own the placement rule where installed; without them, this line is the rule).

## .NET Aspire - orchestration

- The Aspire AppHost is the composition root for the local run and the deployment manifest; service discovery and connection strings flow through it, not hardcoded per service. Depth belongs to the skill covering local cloud-native orchestration, where the install has it; without it, the rules in this section are the whole guidance.
