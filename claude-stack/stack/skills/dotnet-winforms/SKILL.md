# WinForms conventions

For any WinForms or NuGet API surface not pinned down here, resolve signatures with the `context7` MCP rather than memory - never by grepping the NuGet cache or decompiled sources (the routing lesson from a sibling leaf: the MCP sat live and unused because the routing line lived only in a router skill this leaf never loads).

WinForms is an immediate-mode, control-tree desktop UI. The realistic work is maintenance and
modernization of line-of-business apps, not greenfield, so this skill floors **new** work at .NET 8 /
C# 12 while treating **.NET Framework 4.8 as a supported-but-frozen maintenance surface** - fully
serviced, but no new WinForms features land there. The conventions below are the same whichever
runtime you are on; the version-specific mechanics live in the references.

**Read `references/winforms-style.md` before naming a control or handler, hand-editing a `*.Designer.cs`, or touching a user-facing string** - it owns control/event-handler naming, the designer-file round-trip rules, and the resx localization discipline. This SKILL.md owns the architecture (MVP passive view, DI-resolvable forms, disposal, high-DPI, virtual-mode grids); the C# naming baseline is the `csharp` skill. Above these general conventions, a project's own `.editorconfig` and its `<docs-path>/PROJECT-CODE-STYLE.md` win where they diverge.

**Load the version reference for the concrete mechanics:**

- .NET Framework 4.8 (the frozen world) -> **references/net-framework-48.md**
- .NET 8 / 9 / 10 (the strategic target) -> **references/modern-net.md**

Out of scope, by design: the async / nullable / mapping baseline -> `csharp`; deeper MVP, command,
observer, and memento orchestration -> `csharp-design-patterns`; test framework + UI-automation
mechanics -> `dotnet-testing`; the upgrade safety playbook (baseline, staged, rollback) ->
`dotnet-migrate`.

## Logic out of code-behind - the one rule everything rests on

Code-behind translates a UI event into a call on a presenter or ViewModel and does nothing else. No
business rules, no data access, no branching on domain state. This is the single highest-leverage
maintainability move in a WinForms codebase, because everything testable and everything reusable
lives on the far side of that line.

Two ways to draw the line; pick by the age of the code:

- **MVP passive view** - the workhorse for existing 4.8 and modern code because it needs no framework
  support. The Form or UserControl implements a narrow `IView` interface (properties for values,
  events for intent) and holds no logic; the presenter reads and writes the view only through that
  interface and owns every decision, so it unit-tests against a mocked view. In the *supervising
  controller* variant the view is allowed to data-bind directly to the model for simple
  synchronization and the presenter handles only complex logic - less code, weaker testability.
  Default to passive view; reach for supervising controller only when a stateful model must reflect
  into the view through binding anyway.
- **The MVVM binding engine** - a WPF-style `DataContext` / `Command` engine, stable from .NET 8, so
  it is a modern-runtime option only. It lets a ViewModel be shared with WPF/MAUI, but never reaches
  WPF fidelity (no XAML, no `DependencyProperty`, weak converters). Its mechanics live in
  **references/modern-net.md**. On 4.8, MVP is the only separation pattern available.

One presenter (or ViewModel) per view, injected through the constructor. The Form owns no dependency
it could receive instead.

## Forms are DI-resolvable

A Form is a service like any other - resolved from the container, never `new`ed with its
collaborators reached through a static or a field.

- Register forms and services and resolve the main form from the container. The container and startup
  wiring differ by runtime (generic host on modern .NET, a hand-built `ServiceProvider` on 4.8) - see
  the references.
- For a transient child form that needs a runtime argument, inject a **factory delegate**
  (`Func<OrderForm>` or a typed factory), not the container itself. The parent stays ignorant of the
  provider and the factory is trivially stubbed in a test.
- A Form's collaborators arrive through its constructor. If a form reaches for a singleton or a
  service locator, the seam that would have made it testable is gone.

## Async and the UI thread

The async baseline - return `Task`, never block, `ConfigureAwait` placement - is the `csharp` skill's
and applies unchanged. The WinForms-specific points:

- **`async void` only on event handlers**, and wrap the body in try/catch - a fault in an
  `async void` cannot be observed by any caller and becomes an unhandled exception. Everywhere else
  return `Task` / `Task<T>`.
- **Never block the UI thread** with `.Result`, `.Wait()`, or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`. The
  awaited continuation needs the UI thread to resume, but you have blocked it - a deadlock against
  the `WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext`, plus a frozen window. Async all the way, no exceptions.
- **Do not `ConfigureAwait(false)` in a UI event handler** - after it the continuation runs on a
  thread-pool thread and touching a control throws a cross-thread exception. Use it only in the
  UI-agnostic library code you call into.
- **Report progress with `IProgress<T>` / `Progress<T>`** - `Progress<T>` captures the creating
  thread's `SynchronizationContext` and raises its callback there, so a worker reports from any
  thread and the UI update lands safely. Pair it with a `CancellationToken` for cancellation.
- **Marshal back with `Control.Invoke` / `BeginInvoke`.** From .NET 9 prefer the async
  `Control.InvokeAsync`, which removes a class of deadlocks (see **references/modern-net.md**); it does
  not exist on .NET 8 or 4.8 - there, `Invoke`/`BeginInvoke` stay the marshaling primitives.
- **`BackgroundWorker` is legacy** - supported, but no longer the recommended model and it only
  offloads CPU work, not I/O. New code uses `await` for I/O and an awaited `Task.Run` for CPU-bound
  work, marshaling UI updates through `IProgress<T>` or `InvokeAsync`.

## Data binding through a BindingSource

- Bind controls through a **`BindingSource`**, not directly - it centralizes currency, position, and
  change notification and lets you swap the underlying list without rebinding every control.

```csharp
ordersSource.DataSource = new BindingList<Order>(orders);   // IBindingList: grid sees adds/removes
ordersGrid.DataSource = ordersSource;
nameTextBox.DataBindings.Add(
    "Text", ordersSource, nameof(Order.CustomerName),
    formattingEnabled: true, DataSourceUpdateMode.OnPropertyChanged);
```
- Two-way binding requires the bound type to implement **`INotifyPropertyChanged`** (raise it in
  setters); collections must be **`BindingList<T>`** (or another `IBindingList`) so the grid sees
  inserts and deletes. Convert display-to-storage with a `Binding`'s `Format` / `Parse` events.
- **The silent binding leak:** binding to a plain CLR property that does *not* implement
  `INotifyPropertyChanged` makes the framework subscribe through a `PropertyDescriptor`, a strong
  reference that pins the source object for the app's lifetime. Implementing `INotifyPropertyChanged`
  on bound types removes the leak (and is correct anyway). Unhook bindings and dispose the
  `BindingSource` when a dynamically created form tears down.
- Validate with an `ErrorProvider` driven off the `Validating` event, or implement
  `INotifyDataErrorInfo` on the model so errors surface through binding. Do not trust UI-enforced
  constraints as the only validation - the boundary rule is the `dotnet-security` skill's.

## Secrets and the desktop trust boundary

A desktop app cannot keep a secret from the user running it - the process can recover any credential
it is able to use, whatever the runtime - so prefer removing high-value credentials from the client
entirely (broker them through a service or token endpoint) over any local-storage scheme. For the
fields that genuinely must live on the box, Windows DPAPI (`ProtectedData`, `CurrentUser` scope, never
`LocalMachine`) is the local-protection floor; the per-runtime `ProtectedData` mechanics (in-box on
4.8, a package on modern .NET) are in the references. The input-validation boundary and general secret
handling are the `dotnet-security` skill's.

## Disposal is the failure surface - manage it deliberately

Undisposed resources are the dominant WinForms defect, in two families: managed event-handler leaks
and native GDI / USER handle leaks. What an ordinary edit has to get right:

- **Unsubscribe when a shorter-lived object subscribed to a longer-lived one** - detach in
  `OnClosed` / `Dispose`. A parent-to-child handler needs no detach; their lifetimes are tied.
- **Wrap every `System.Drawing` object you create in `using`** - `Pen`, `Brush`, `Font`, `Graphics`,
  `Bitmap`, `Icon`, `Region` each hold a native handle from a bounded per-process quota, and
  exhausting it throws or paints windows with missing content.
- **A modal dialog from `ShowDialog()` is not auto-disposed** - wrap it in `using`. Neither is a
  control or non-visual component you created in code rather than dropping in the designer.
- **A custom control that owns `IDisposable` fields** overrides `Dispose(bool disposing)`, disposes
  them inside `if (disposing)`, and calls `base.Dispose(disposing)` (analyzers `CA1063` / `CA2215`).

**Read `references/disposal-and-leaks.md` before writing owner-draw or `OnPaint` code, before adding
a dynamically created control or component, and whenever you are hunting a handle leak** - it carries
the per-case rules (which system objects are cached and must NOT be disposed, the `DataGridView`
per-cell font trap, where automatic container disposal stops) and the flat-handle-count acceptance
bar that gates a ship or a migration.

Before any done word on a UI change: build the app, open and close the affected form twenty times, and quote the GDI and USER
handle counts from Task Manager at the start and the end. A count that keeps climbing is the leak, whatever the code review said.

## Performance: batch, virtualize, bind

- Wrap bulk mutations in `SuspendLayout()` / `ResumeLayout()`, and use `BeginUpdate()` / `EndUpdate()`
  on `ListView` / `ListBox` / `TreeView` / `ComboBox` to suppress intermediate repaints.
- Enable double buffering to cut flicker - note it is a protected property on `DataGridView`, so turn
  it on through a subclass rather than assuming the public toggle exists.
- **Populate a grid through `DataSource`, not row-by-row `Rows.Add`** - unbound population is
  dramatically slower for large sets.
- For large datasets set `VirtualMode = true` on `DataGridView` / `ListView` and serve cells on
  demand, so only visible rows materialize. General perf and type-design guidance is the
  `dotnet-performance` skill's.

## High-DPI: PerMonitorV2 is the target

Target **Per-Monitor V2** DPI awareness - it enables dynamic DPI-change handling and automatic
non-client scaling. *How* you declare it differs by runtime (app.config plus a manifest on 4.8, a
build property on modern .NET) - see the references.

- Every container must use the **same `AutoScaleMode`**; mixing modes is unsupported. The default
  `AutoScaleMode.Font` scales by the system font, which is why the default-font change across
  runtimes ripples into designer layout (covered in **references/modern-net.md**).
- Test on a genuinely mixed-DPI multi-monitor setup - a window opened on a secondary monitor can
  briefly scale at the primary monitor's DPI.

## Testing: unit the presenters, automate the critical path

- The whole point of the architecture is that presenters, ViewModels, and services carry the logic
  and have no WinForms dependency, so they unit-test with a mocked `IView` and injected fakes - fast,
  deterministic, no UI thread. This is the return on keeping code-behind thin.
- UI end-to-end automation rides Windows UI Automation; **FlaUI** is the modern choice and keeps to
  smoke and critical-path coverage only. Do not adopt WinAppDriver fresh (see
  **references/net-framework-48.md** for why). Test framework and structure are the `dotnet-testing`
  skill's.

## Forbidden in a presenter or ViewModel

- Any reference to a `Form`, `UserControl`, `Control`, or other view type - the moment one appears,
  the line has been crossed and the logic is no longer testable without a UI host.
- `MessageBox.Show` - go through an injected dialog abstraction.
