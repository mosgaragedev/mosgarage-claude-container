Editing hand-written SQL - load `database-conventions`: the FIRST action after this rule attaches is
that Skill call, before the NEXT edit lands (a path-scoped rule attaches ON the touch, so it can never
precede its own trigger) - skip the load when it is already in context (some seats preload it);
conventions are the source of truth, not recall. Name the skill you loaded, or say it was already in
context - the receipt is what makes the load happen.

Hand-written `.sql` only; ORM / EF query logic lives in a `.cs` file and routes through the C#
baseline and the ORM / data-access skill instead. Skip one-line tweaks.
