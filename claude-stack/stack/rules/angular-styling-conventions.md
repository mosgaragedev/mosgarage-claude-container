Editing stylesheets in an Angular / Ionic workspace - load `angular-styling`: the FIRST action after this rule attaches is that Skill call, before the NEXT edit lands (a path-scoped rule attaches ON the touch, so it can never precede its own trigger) - skip the load when it is already in context (some seats preload it);
conventions are the source of truth, not recall. Name the skill you loaded, or say it was already
in context - the receipt is what makes the load happen. Governs `.scss`/`.css` component-scoped styling,
Material or not. Skip one-line tweaks.
