# Security

## Reviewing a security-relevant diff

- Crypto / secret / auth / payment / data-access work: review the diff for vulnerabilities before
presenting it, over the FULL change set with the reset chained into the SAME call -
`git add -N . && git diff HEAD; git reset -q` - because a diff-fed review silently skips brand-new
files, the most security-relevant code in most changes. The method, the `/security-review` bound and
the exemption logic live in `project-commit-checkpoint`'s security half. On these paths the review is
part of the pre-commit checkpoint: the `COMMIT-GATE` receipt (project-commit-checkpoint) is written `VERIFIED`
only after it ran - an auth-path diff committed on the code review alone shipped unreviewed to a
shared branch.
- Three honesty rules on that path. A skip on 'the diff is test-only' is a claim - verify it from
the diff's own file list and name the carve-out in the close ('security review: skipped - test-only
diff: <paths>'), never a silent unilateral call.
An inline review is a substantive checklist pass with per-category findings named - a one-line 'no
issues' nod over a secrets-adjacent diff is not a review. And when the user overrides a security recommendation,
proceed - their call - but the close and any receipt record the override with the risk named and
their words quoted, so the decision is auditable.
- Never log PII, tokens, passwords, or full payment data - and a change that WIDENS logging (a
default flipped verbose, a redaction removed, a new sink) is itself security-relevant work riding
the review path above.

## Credentials

- Hardcoded secret found, or one the user pastes: stop, flag, redact as `<redacted>`, recommend rotation + git-history removal - and use a pasted one for the job they asked for, since it is in the transcript on disk either way. Never propagate the value into any tool. The turn does not end on that bullet - it ends on the ask (rotate now / acknowledge and defer), because a discovered exposure stated as prose gets abandoned. ONCE: an answered ask covers every credential already in the session, only a new exposure asks again, and `CLAUDE_STACK_ROTATE_ASK=0` in the settings.json env turns it off.
- `permissions.deny` blocks the Read TOOL on secret files (`.env*`, key/cert globs) and NOTHING else - not a shell `cat`, not a subprocess. Measured: an account carrying `Read(**/config.json)` returned two Bash `cat`s of a config.json unblocked. The rule below is the only thing covering those routes.
- Reading a credential means reading its PRESENCE, never its value: `KEY=set (N chars)` or `absent`, and a generated artifact is checked by grepping for the prefix and reporting the count. The sanctioned one-key read is `guard-secret-value.js --presence <file> [KEY ...]`. Never echo a value, never pass a pasted secret to a tool, and never ask for one through the chat - it goes into the file by the user's own hand, or by a copy-ready command they run in their terminal. When the VALUE itself is what the user needs - shown to them, or placed where a blind copy (`jq ... > file`, `cp`, `sed -i`) cannot reach - the guard's block ends in ONE AskUserQuestion ('Presence only' recommended), and a 'show or use it' answer is honoured through the `<docs-path>/flow/SECRET-READ-ALLOW` receipt (a file, a variable name, or `*`; this session only, under 8h): the user decides, the model never does.
- **Name a credential by its KEY and its char count, never by a fragment of the value.** `SENTRY_ACCESS_TOKEN=set (71 chars)` identifies it; 'the token ending `...a1b2c3d`' is the value leaking a piece at a time, into prose the transcript keeps forever, and it identifies nothing the key does not. The same holds for a prefix, a middle slice, and a 'first/last N' fingerprint used to compare two values - compare char counts, or have the user compare.
- **A rotation option is SELF-CONTAINED.** Every option in the rotate ask names the site, the action and the command in its own description - never a back-reference to something said earlier ('the copy-ready command given earlier', 'as described above'): an ask can be answered hours later, in a scrolled-past chat, by a user who never saw that turn.

<!-- Maintainer note: extend the deny list in settings.json with the stack's own secret/config globs. -->
