Editing Angular / Ionic framework code - load `angular-conventions` (on top of the `typescript`
baseline): the FIRST action after this rule attaches is that Skill call, before the NEXT edit lands (a path-scoped rule attaches ON the touch, so it can never precede its own trigger) - even when the touch is incidental to the session's main thread (measured: this rule and the TypeScript one both attached, their bodies
entered the session, and neither skill was loaded across 12 edits). Skip the load when it is already
in context (some seats preload it); conventions are the source of truth, not recall. Say which
layers you loaded, or that they were already in context - the receipt is what makes the load happen.
Covers components, services, directives, pipes, guards, resolvers, modules, routes, and templates -
an Ionic/Capacitor app shares the same conventions (a bespoke layout outside `src/app` / `src/lib`:
load the skill yourself). In an Ionic/Capacitor workspace (`ionic.config.json` /
`capacitor.config.*` present) the Ionic/Capacitor conventions skill - the one covering Ionic Angular
UI, the Capacitor lifecycle and plugins - loads in the SAME first action, not as an optional
companion: it overrides where Ionic diverges (shell change detection, zoneless, forms,
transitions, refresh-on-entry); measured: one session edited IonIcon components with
`angular-conventions` loaded and the Ionic skill never loaded, leaving the Ionic trap list unaudited.
None installed in an Ionic workspace: the mobile stack is missing from this install - say so in the
close. Skip one-line tweaks.

<!-- Maintainer note: the src/app / src/lib directory globs exist to catch the v20 suffix-less file names the type-suffix globs miss. -->
