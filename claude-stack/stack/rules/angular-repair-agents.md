<!-- The styling globs are load-bearing, not over-breadth: a Sass compile error IS an ng build
     failure, and styles.scss / theme files are build inputs. Fires on green edits by design -
     build state has no glob; this soft router replaced the retired hard gate. -->

A broken Angular build or red spec suite (Ionic/Capacitor included - ionic build wraps ng
build) - delegating beats looping in-session; the run's session-or-agents pick, or the user's word, decides - absent both, offer the resolver through AskUserQuestion (resolver seat vs in-session fix, resolver recommended): fix-the-build goes to
**`ng-build-error-resolver`**, make-the-tests-pass goes to **`angular-test-resolver`** once
the build is green. The subagent absorbs the repeated build/test output and returns only a
diagnosis. A resolver that stops as BLOCKED_CONTRACT_CHANGE hit a fix needing a
shared-contract change - outside its bounded scope by design; a running `project-solve-cross-task`
flow handles it per its contract protocol - otherwise name `/project-solve-cross-task` as the
user's next step (the skill is manual-only; a model Skill call is blocked). Never edit the
contract to go green. A seat with no Agent tool (an implementer or a resolver) does NOT delegate - this routing policy is the orchestrator's; run your own bounded fix loop and report the red per your cap. A diagnoser carries the Agent tool but its one sanctioned dispatch is the evidence-gatherer: it names the resolver in its report, never dispatches one.
