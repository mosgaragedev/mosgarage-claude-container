Editing a container build, a compose topology, a CI/CD pipeline or a deploy script - load `devops`:
the FIRST action after this rule attaches is that Skill call, before the NEXT edit lands (a
path-scoped rule attaches ON the touch, so it can never precede its own trigger) - skip the load when
it is already in context (the devops seats preload it); conventions are the source of truth, not
recall. Name the skill you loaded, or say it was already in context - the receipt is what makes the
load happen.

Covers Dockerfiles, compose files, GitHub Actions workflows and `deploy*.sh` / `deploy*.ps1` - the
delivery surface. Skip one-line tweaks.

<!-- Maintainer note: the deploy-script globs are a deliberate widening - a session that edits only a
     deploy script touches no Dockerfile, so the rule that names the concern could never reach it. -->
