<!-- Fires on every .NET file touch by design: build state has no glob, and this soft router
     replaced the retired require-convention-skill hard gate. The rent is these few lines. -->

A broken .NET build or red test suite - delegating beats looping in-session; the run's session-or-agents pick, or the user's word, decides - absent both, offer the resolver through AskUserQuestion (resolver seat vs in-session fix, resolver recommended):
fix-the-build goes to **`dotnet-build-error-resolver`** (MC#### errors = WPF XAML markup
compile are its scope too), make-the-tests-pass goes to **`dotnet-test-failure-resolver`**
once the build is green. The subagent absorbs the repeated build/test output and returns
only a diagnosis. A resolver that stops as BLOCKED_CONTRACT_CHANGE hit a fix needing a
shared-contract change - outside its bounded scope by design; a running `project-solve-cross-task`
flow handles it per its contract protocol - otherwise name `/project-solve-cross-task` as the
user's next step (the skill is manual-only; a model Skill call is blocked). Never edit the
contract to go green. A seat with no Agent tool (an implementer or a resolver) does NOT delegate - this routing policy is the orchestrator's; run your own bounded fix loop and report the red per your cap. A diagnoser carries the Agent tool but its one sanctioned dispatch is the evidence-gatherer: it names the resolver in its report, never dispatches one.
