// and push are one gate family and share the receipt machinery, the heredoc blanking and the
// quote masking below. A non-trivial
// `git commit` runs only after the house review gate (project-verify-code, plus
// /security-review on auth/crypto/data-access paths) or the user's explicit waiver -
// recorded as a receipt file the gate step writes. Prose measured unreliable: 8 ungated
// commit events across 6 audited sessions, including one where baseline-git.md was
// provably read into context the same session and skipped anyway, and one commit with
// no user authorization at all. Trivial diffs pass untouched (the rule's own
// typo/one-line exemption, judged from the working-tree diff). exit 2 = block
// (stderr fed back to the model); exit 0 = allow.
// The PUBLISH half: `git push` and `gh pr merge` put the work where other people (and CI) get
// it, and NOTHING gated them - replayed across four bundles, every push and merge passed every
// guard. In one session the FIRST state-changing act of the run published unpushed commits 18
// minutes before any receipt existed, and 40 files reached a shared `develop` ungated. Same
// receipt shape, its own file (<docs-root>/flow/PUSH-GATE), and CLAUDE_STACK_PUSH_GATE=0 turns
// it off for a repo whose remote is already gated by branch protection or a required review.
// Receipt lifecycle: the gate step writes <docs-root>/flow/COMMIT-GATE when its checks
// pass (VERIFIED <scope>) or the user explicitly waives (WAIVED - "<their words>");
// the commit turn clears it after the commit lands. Receipts older than
// MAX_RECEIPT_AGE_MS are treated as absent - the stale-stamp lesson from the approval
// gate (a leftover stamp silently authorized later, unrelated runs).
