// fresh-session construction check (the flow skills' stop contracts) both failed as prose in
// every audited strengthening - measured across 123 sessions: ~25 sessions ended turns on
// 'say the word' / 'want me to X?' prose (stalls of 13min-37h, one plaintext-credential
// decision dropped at /exit), and the 150k fresh-session option fired in ~0 of 50+ qualifying

// Stop wiring: a turn that ends on a decision-shaped question in PROSE (no AskUserQuestion
//   call in the final assistant message) is blocked - the model re-emits it as the tool call.
//   The text judged is the payload's `last_assistant_message` (the harness's own copy of the
//   turn's final text); the transcript tail is the fallback for a build that does not send it.
//   The same Stop wiring carries the fresh-session offer: on a CLEAN close past the
//   window-scaled trigger, the turn is held once so the user is asked whether to continue here
//   or resume fresh. It fires only after the work is done (never mid-response, which is what the
//   old PreToolUse denial did), and re-arms only when the context has grown 1.5x since the last
//   one - so a long session is asked once per real cost step, not once per question.
// PreToolUse (AskUserQuestion) wiring: INJECTION ONLY - `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`,
//   presence-only, never ranks an option and never denies. It carries the four checks that have no
//   other route (stale ask scope, a recommendation contradicting an un-actioned request, the
//   fresh-session offer for a flow whose every stop is a tool call, and a live credential) plus the
//   house-voice check on the ask's own text. The DENIAL this matcher used to carry is gone for
