// installer-managed - update overwrites local edits; put project policy in a separate hook file.
// PreToolUse gate (matchers: Write + Edit + NotebookEdit + Bash): a session belongs to ONE
// project. Work in project A that turns out to need a change in project B - a sibling repo, a
// consumed package, a related service - is HANDED OFF, never applied: the session writes a task
// card for B and stops there. Reading and investigating B is untouched (no Read/Grep/Glob
// matcher), because deciding what B must do requires reading B.
//
// Why a hook and not prose: a cross-repo edit is a discrete event with a decidable test (does
// the write target resolve inside this project's root?), and the cost of getting it wrong is
// the expensive kind - a change landing in a repo whose tests, conventions, review and release
// this session never ran, invisible to the project that owns it.
//
// Reads pass. Writes inside the project root pass. Writes to the session's own scratch (the OS
// temp dir), to the Claude account dirs (~/.claude and the ~/.claude-<space> siblings - settings,
// memory, plugins), and to /dev pass. Everything else is blocked - and the block ENDS IN AN ASK:
// the denial mandates one AskUserQuestion (task card here - recommended; allow that tree for this
// session; drop), because a bare denial left the user out of the decision (the model wrote the
// card or just stopped). The 'allow' answer is honoured through a session receipt, below.
// On Bash the write-shaped verbs are judged where they actually land: a `cd`/`pushd` earlier in
// the same command moves the anchor for every relative path and every bare `git <mutating>` after
// it (`cd ../other && git commit` is the same write as `git -C ../other commit` - reproduced
// passing before this existed), while a `>` or a verb INSIDE a quoted string is prose, not a
// write (a commit message reading 'pipe > /other/f' blocked the commit - reproduced).
// exit 2 = block (stderr fed back); exit 0 = allow. Fail-open on anything unparseable, on a root
// that cannot be resolved, and on a target that cannot be judged (an unexpanded variable, a
// relative path after `cd -` or `cd $DIR`).
// Out of scope (same honesty as the sibling guards): a write hidden from a flat scan -
// `--git-dir=`/`--work-tree=`, `bash -c '...'`, `eval`, `xargs rm`, `find ... -delete`, a
// wrapper script - is NOT caught here; this guard reads the literal command.
