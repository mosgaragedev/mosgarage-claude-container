// The short-answer contract (baseline-interaction.md: 'at most 3 sentences plus points', 'if the
// user wants deeper detail they will ask') failed as prose the same way every other house mandate
// did: the user re-asked for it as a BRAND NEW rule while both rule copies carried it verbatim,
// and the memory record holds four separate 'you write too much text' / 'shorter and simpler'
// corrections across sessions. Prose guards measured ignored 1/5-1/3 of the time; mechanisms held.
// This hook is the mechanization.
//
// UserPromptSubmit wiring: appends the answer budget to the turn's context, where it lands LAST -
//   immediately before the answer is written, not 30 bullets deep in an always-on rule. It also
//   carries the FORMAT ASK on a correction streak: the third consecutive short human turn that
//   follows a long answer gets one line naming the interaction rule's 're-ask on the SAME
//   deliverable -> ONE format AskUserQuestion' - injection only, never a denial. Measured lost as
//   prose: nine corrections and nine redrafts of one report, 1.64M cache-read, no ask.
// Stop wiring: an answer whose prose (code blocks, tables and inline spans excluded) runs past the
//   hard cap with no depth request in the user's own message is blocked, and the model re-answers
//   at budget. The answer measured is the payload's `last_assistant_message`; the transcript's
//   assistant row is the fallback, and the user's own message always comes from the transcript.
//   Deliberately a wall-of-text catch, not a byte-counter: the soft budget lives in the reminder
//   because a Stop block cannot unsay text the user already read - it can only add more.
// SessionStart wiring: re-emits the budget as additionalContext whenever the harness rebuilds the
//   context (startup, resume, clear, compact) - a compaction drops the UserPromptSubmit injection.
