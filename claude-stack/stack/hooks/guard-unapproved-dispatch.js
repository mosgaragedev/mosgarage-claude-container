// installer-managed - update overwrites local edits; put project policy in a separate hook file.
// PreToolUse gate (matcher: Task|Agent): the approval gate for implementer fan-out.
// An *-implementer dispatch is the expensive, hard-to-reverse step of a build flow -
// it runs only after the user's explicit approval (or an explicit 'run without stops'
// waiver), recorded as a gate file the flows write. Prose approval gates measured
// unreliable (collapse on an ambiguous 'go'); this converts the gate into a file
// check the dispatch tool cannot pass without. Designers pass (they produce the plan
// BEFORE approval exists) and verifiers pass (read-only audits; verify-plan dispatches
// one pre-approval). exit 2 = block (stderr fed back to the model); exit 0 = allow.
// Stamp lifecycle: each flow/loop writes its OWN stamp when its consent lands and
// clears it at run end; a stamp persists across a flow's resumed sessions until that
// clear. Stamps older than MAX_STAMP_AGE_MS are treated as absent - measured: a
// leftover stamp from a finished flow silently authorized three later, unrelated
// runs' dispatches in one consuming project.
// Generic-seat rule: while a VALID stamp exists (a flow is running), an edit-capable
// generic dispatch (general-purpose/claude) is blocked too - flows dispatch NAMED
// domain seats, and the name-keyed implementer gate is silently bypassed by a generic
// stand-in (measured: one run put all 10 of a loop's dispatches on general-purpose,
// losing every seat pin and this gate; one legitimate generic dispatch in 33 audited
// sessions would have been bounced, a one-retry re-route). Outside a stamped flow,
// generic seats pass untouched.
// Symbol-search rule: a SYMBOL question - who calls this, where is it declared, what
// type resolves here - is never delegated to a grep-shaped seat (Explore/general-purpose/
// claude). Those answer by name-match, and the built-in Explore does not even load the
// project's rules, so baseline-navigation's 'locate with serena, inline' never reaches it
// (measured: a consuming session handed a C# symbol hunt to Explore and got grep hits).
// Blocked here regardless of any stamp; a broad multi-file sweep with no symbol question
// in it still passes.
