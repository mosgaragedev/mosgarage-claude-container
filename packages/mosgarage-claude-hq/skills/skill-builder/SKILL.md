name: skill-builder
description: >-
  Orchestrates the complete skill-building lifecycle using evaluation-driven
  development. Routes through gap analysis, eval creation, skill writing (via
  skill-writer), subagent testing (via skill-creator infrastructure), and
  iterative refinement. Use when creating new skills, improving existing skills,
  or optimizing skill descriptions. Triggers: 'build a skill', 'new skill
  workflow', 'improve this skill', 'optimize skill description', 'skill
  development lifecycle'.

# Skill Builder

**Core principle:** Evaluation-driven development. Build evals BEFORE writing extensive documentation. This ensures skills solve real problems rather than documenting imagined ones.

Source: [Anthropic Skill Best Practices - Evaluation and Iteration](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices#evaluation-and-iteration)

## When this skill applies

Trigger for requests to **build**, **improve**, or **polish** a skill through the full evaluation-driven lifecycle. This skill orchestrates the process -- it delegates writing to `/skill-writer` and evaluation infrastructure to the `skill-creator` plugin.

For quick skill syntax questions or one-off SKILL.md edits, use `/skill-writer` directly instead.

## Routing

Assess the user's intent from conversation context and existing artifacts. Route directly:

**Creating a new skill?**
Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/new-skill.md` and follow it.

**Improving an existing skill?**
Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/improve-skill.md` and follow it.

**Final polish only (description optimization, trigger eval)?**
Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/workflows/polish-skill.md` and follow it.

**Ambiguous?** Ask: "Are you creating a new skill, improving an existing one, or doing a final polish pass?"

## The Claude A / Claude B Pattern

You and the user are **Claude A** -- the expert who designs and refines the skill. Subagents running the built skill on eval tasks are **Claude B** -- the agent using the skill to perform real work.

> "Work with one instance of Claude ('Claude A') to create a Skill that is used by other instances ('Claude B'). Claude A helps you design and refine instructions, while Claude B tests them in real tasks."

The feedback loop: observe Claude B's behavior, bring insights back, refine the skill, test again.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Purpose | Delegated To |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Identify gaps | Document what fails without the skill | This skill (guided conversation) |
| 2. Build evals | Create 3+ scenarios testing the gaps | This skill (templates + user input) |
| 3. Write skill | Minimal instructions addressing gaps | `/skill-writer` |
| 4. Test | Subagent runs with/without skill, grade, benchmark | `skill-creator` eval infrastructure |
| 5. Iterate | Review results, refine, re-test | This skill + `/skill-writer` + Phase 4 |
| 6. Polish | Description optimization, trigger eval, final check | `skill-creator` description optimizer |

## Ground-up skill package (required reference)

When building a **new** skill as a **full package** (architecture inventory, progressive disclosure files, `evals/`, **human checkpoint after each file**), treat the following as **mandatory** before implementation:

- **Read:** `prompt-generator/templates/skill-from-ground-up.md` inside the claude-dev-env `skills/` directory (repository path: `packages/claude-dev-env/skills/prompt-generator/templates/skill-from-ground-up.md`).
- **Do:** Run `/prompt-generator` with that file’s token table filled so the downstream session follows architecture-first sequencing, per-file review gates, and eval rows tied only to user-pasted or explicitly approved evidence.

Use this **together with** gap-analysis and eval-scenario templates in this package; the ground-up template supplies the **orchestration contract** for the multi-file layout Anthropic recommends.

## Refinement skill package (required reference)

When **improving** an existing skill as a **multi-file** or **checkpointed** package (baseline directory plus planned deltas, observation-grounded evals), treat the following as **mandatory** before Phase 2–6 file work in `improve-skill.md` or package-aware steps in `polish-skill.md`:

- **Read:** `prompt-generator/templates/skill-refinement-package.md` (repository path: `packages/claude-dev-env/skills/prompt-generator/templates/skill-refinement-package.md`).
- **Do:** Run `/prompt-generator` with that file’s token table filled (`[[BASELINE_SKILL_ROOT]]`, `[[WORKSPACE_ROOT]]`, observation gap path, evidence rule) so rollout stays architecture-first, delta-focused, and tied to real observation or approved excerpts.

Net-new packages without a baseline skill directory use `skill-from-ground-up.md` instead.

## Principles (apply across all phases)

1. **Evals before documentation.** Never write extensive skill content without evaluation scenarios to validate it.

2. **Minimal instructions first.** Write just enough to pass evaluations. Resist the urge to over-document.

3. **Generalize from feedback.** The skill will be used across many prompts. Do not overfit to test cases.

4. **Explain the why.** Theory of mind beats rigid rules. Help the model understand reasoning, not just constraints.

5. **Observe, do not assume.** Iterate based on what Claude B actually does, not what you think it should do.
