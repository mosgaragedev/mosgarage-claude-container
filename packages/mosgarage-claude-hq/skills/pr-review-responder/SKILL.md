# PR Review Responder

**This skill is MANDATORY when responding to PR review comments.**

IF you are addressing PR review feedback, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL.

**Why this matters:** A typical multi-commit PR with many review comments is easy to fumble. Missing even one comment forces another review round.

## MANDATORY FIRST RESPONSE PROTOCOL

Before doing ANYTHING:

1. [ ] Fetch ALL review comments with `per_page=100` pagination
2. [ ] Create TodoWrite checklist with ONE item per comment
3. [ ] Fix comments ONE AT A TIME, marking complete as you go
4. [ ] Draft reply for EVERY comment (DO NOT post directly)
5. [ ] Create ONE review fix commit (DO NOT squash with original)
6. [ ] Run pre-push-review skill before pushing
7. [ ] Verify ALL draft replies are prepared

**Responding WITHOUT completing this checklist = automatic failure.**

## Critical Rules - NO EXCEPTIONS

### Rule 1: Fetch ALL Comments First

**NEVER start fixing without fetching every comment.**

- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Assuming you know what the comments say
- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Using default pagination (30 results, causes missed comments)
- [x] REQUIRED: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments?per_page=100`
- [x] REQUIRED: Check for additional pages if 100+ comments

**WHY:** Missing comments forces extra review rounds. Default pagination (30) silently drops comments.

### Rule 2: TodoWrite Checklist Before Any Fixes

**NEVER make fixes without a checklist.**

- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Fixing comments as you read them
- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Bulk-updating todos after fixing multiple items
- [x] REQUIRED: Create TodoWrite with one item per comment BEFORE any fix
- [x] REQUIRED: Include BOTH fix items AND reply items

**WHY:** Without a checklist, you WILL miss comments.

Example checklist:
```
- [ ] Fix: src/views.py:45 - Use shared upload function
- [ ] Fix: src/models.py:23 - Rename user_name to display_name
- [ ] Reply: src/views.py:45 - Post inline response
- [ ] Reply: src/models.py:23 - Post inline response
```

### Rule 3: Fix Systematically

**NEVER skip ahead or bulk-update.**

For each comment in TodoWrite:
1. Read the comment
2. Make the fix
3. Mark todo item complete: `[x]`
4. Verify fix addresses comment
5. Move to next comment

### Rule 4: Draft Replies for User Review

**NEVER post comments directly. Draft them for user to review and post.**

Format each draft reply:
```
DRAFT REPLIES (for user to post):
================================

Comment #1 (file.py:45 - "description"):
Reply: Fixed: [specific description of what was changed]

Comment #2 (file.py:67 - "description"):
Reply: Fixed: [specific description of what was changed]
```

**Reply quality rules:**
- Concise: One sentence maximum
- Specific: Say WHAT changed, not just "fixed"
- Actionable: Reviewer can verify the fix

### Rule 5: Separate Review Fix Commit

**NEVER squash review fixes into the original commit.**

- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Amending the original commit with review fixes
- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Multiple fix commits for the same review round
- [x] REQUIRED: ONE new commit for all review fixes from this round

**WHY:** Squashing shows the ENTIRE feature as new on GitHub instead of just the delta. Keeping commits separate lets the reviewer click the second commit to see exactly what changed.

```bash
git add [files]
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback

- Fixed: [specific change 1]
- Fixed: [specific change 2]

Addresses review comments from PR #{number}"
```

### Rule 6: Run Pre-Push Review

**NEVER push without running pre-push-review skill.**

- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Pushing without pre-push-review
- [ ] FORBIDDEN: Manually handling draft conversion
- [x] REQUIRED: Invoke pre-push-review skill which handles all 24 checks + draft conversion

**WHY:** Pre-push-review catches ALL patterns reviewers flag: code style, draft status, commit structure. Delegating to it ensures nothing is missed.

### Rule 7: Verify All Drafts Complete

**NEVER declare success without matching draft count to comment count.**

- Count of drafts must match count of comments
- Each draft must reference a specific fix
- Present drafts in clear format for user to copy

## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail

- **"I know what the comments say, no need to fetch"** -> WRONG. Missing comments forces extra review rounds.
- **"Let me fix this one quickly before making the checklist"** -> WRONG. Without checklist you will miss others.
- **"I'll post the replies myself to save time"** -> WRONG. User controls what gets posted.
- **"This is a small fix, I can squash it"** -> WRONG. Squashing hides the delta from reviewers.
- **"Pre-push review is overkill for review fixes"** -> WRONG. It catches style issues you introduced while fixing.

## Final Report Format

Only after ALL validations pass:

```
PR Review Response Complete

Fetched: {X} comments (with per_page=100)
Fixed: {X} issues
Pre-push review: PASSED (all 24 checks)
Draft replies: {X} prepared for user
Commits: 2 (original + review fix, NOT squashed)

TodoWrite checklist: 100% complete

DRAFT REPLIES FOR USER TO POST:
================================
[List all draft replies here]

PR #{number}: {url}

Ready to push!
```

## Edge Cases

**No review comments found:**
Report with verification that per_page=100 was used.

**Comments but no matching changes:**
List the comments and their file locations, ask if fixes were forgotten.

**PR already merged:**
Cannot add review responses to merged PRs. Report error.

## Response Format Rules

**Good replies:**
- Fixed: Removed wrapper function, using direct storage.upload_file()
- Fixed: Extracted shared logic to utils/view_helpers.py
- Fixed: Renamed user_name to display_name to avoid User.username conflict
- Noted: Will handle in separate PR to avoid scope creep

**Bad replies:**
- "Fixed" (not specific)
- "Done" (lazy)
- "Addressed your comment" (tells reviewer nothing)

## Requirements

- `gh` CLI installed and authenticated
- Current branch must have an open PR
- Git repository with remote on GitHub
- Write access to repository

## Remember

This protocol prevents repeated review failures. Being systematic is NOT optional. Missing even ONE comment wastes everyone's time.
