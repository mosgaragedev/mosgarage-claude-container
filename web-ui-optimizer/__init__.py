    Basic automation:
        from remote_playwright import RemotePlaywright

        with RemotePlaywright() as pw:
            pw.new_context()

            screenshots = optimizer.capture_responsive("https://mosgarage.xyz")
            colors = optimizer.analyze_colors()
            accessibility = optimizer.check_accessibility()

    Connection testing:
        from connection import wait_for_playwright_service, verify_connection
